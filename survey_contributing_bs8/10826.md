# CONTRIBUTING#
  
 Welcome! We are glad about your willingness to contribute to this project, making it robust and feature-rich with a great experience to all of our end-users and developers alike. All contributions are greatly encouraged and will be evaluated carefully. We aim for a welcoming, supportive community for all.

  We believe that everyone can contribute, regardless of your coding experience. Contributions are not solely about code - improving documentation, writing tutorials, providing feedback, or helping maintain community resources are incredibly valuable. Your involvement is vital as we build a thriving environment to foster innovation.

  This guide details our guidelines and provides a standardized workflow for contributors. By submitting pull requests, you confirm you' ve reviewed this guide, that you agree with our standards, and will act respectfully toward other contributors. Please read it thoroughly before submitting any contribution.
 
## 1. Code of Conduct

 We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community. All participants are expected to treat each other with respect and kindness, regardless of differences in experience, expertise, or identity. We strive to foster a collaborative and supportive environment to allow everyone to feel safe and respected. 

 Bullying, harassment, or any form of discrimination will not be tolerated. We expect all contributors to be open-minded and respectful of differing opinions and perspectives. If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact a maintainer immediately.

 Any violations of this Code of Conduct, will result in warnings, temporary suspensions, or, in severe cases, permanent bans from the project. We are determined to maintain a positive atmosphere that promotes innovation and learning in a welcoming environment.

## 2. Getting Started

   To get started, fork the repository on GitHub, then create a new branch from `main` for your changes.  Using a descriptive branch name ( e.g. `fix/typo-in-readme`, `feature/new-login`) will make reviewing your changes easier for everyone. Avoid direct commits to the `main` branch and always use a branch to manage your contributions.

   First and foremost, you will need to install the project dependencies to run it locally. This project uses `pip` for dependency installation. It would look like: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  The virtual environment setup is important to avoid global conflicts of dependency installations and it helps keep everything organized in your projects.

   We utilize Poetry for dependency management and environment handling, a Python-native package that helps streamline the project. You may use this if Poetry has been chosen.  `poetry install` installs and setup dependencies with virtual env and manages them efficiently for future builds and updates.  After that step is completed, you may use Poetry commands.

   Now build the project using our `Makefile` to ensure full functionality: `make build`. If using poetry: `poetry build` . If no instructions provided or if a custom script needs to be executed you may do that at this step too. If something went wrong you can see errors that were thrown during compilation. 

   Finally, you can start your server to view all project dependencies running: `python main.py` (for Python-based applications). This will allow to quickly inspect and view the code, ensuring you understand everything succinctly and effectively before diving deeper in development efforts. 

## 3. How to Contribute

 We appreciate all kinds of contributions - big or small. Feel free to propose and suggest changes, but it might require a few iterations of discussion between the parties to achieve best possible quality before committing it on our project and merging with master. Donot be afraid to submit an early-state change, it's far better to do it early rather than at the end stage!

 Submitting an idea via creating an Issue, will enable discussion about possible improvements to be implemented, and will also make it more accessible to other contributors with different perspectives that may add even more quality to what we're developing here. 

  Creating high-quality documentation, improving the code quality (refactoring existing functionalities and cleaning them, adding tests), are also important ways that can benefit our users in general and help with onboarding for future members.  We encourage to propose improvements for these tasks as well - with every effort to keep documentation clean and readable to make contributions simple for others.  

 Donot be shy when implementing major refactor or new functionalities to ask maintainers to take a peek beforehand and provide guidance for best-approach implementation - that can prevent rework at a later step in future stages of project implementation lifecycle. This is important because sometimes it may seem trivial, however can lead to unpredicted complications at other layers or modules of code in other stages! 

## 4. Reporting Bugs

 To report a bug, please open a new issue on the project page with as much detail as possible. Provide specific error messages or the behavior exhibited instead of a general statement to ensure we properly grab your context on this one. Include versioning of packages or versions if that matters.

 If possible, create a reproducible example to make the issue clearer and allow the developers to reproduce. A minimum working example or code snippets is highly beneficial to the developer and speeds up resolving time to make sure things can function accordingly.  It also prevents unnecessary communication loops by giving us more clarity in a first stage.

   When creating an issue make great care of writing descriptive and informative names to easily grab developer focus, for a better triage stage. Clear, short subject lines can drastically cut-down developer triage time.  We rely heavily on the community and want everything resolved swiftly so the product functions as designed, with maximum stability at the best quality for the best value in time. 

 To submit a good quality issue please follow our standard and be descriptive of what you are observing over the intended outcome that we were going for to avoid misunderstanding. We appreciate all the input that will lead to our product becoming greater over the years for us to proudly showcase as the industry leader in all categories involved with our project's goals.

## 5. Suggesting Enhancements

 When proposing enhancements to our current system we need a well described proposal so all maintainers are able to understand where we should move in our roadmap. Describe the intended feature with its use-cases or why its implementation makes great use case or solves any problem for the project and/or current/future stakeholders to make our decisions informed in a data driven decisioning stage. 

 Be clear on why it needs implementing now and if you already worked up a basic prototype. It's okay even at its infancy to submit one for a starting point so everyone in our team knows what to start at, what we expect at and can plan on future implementations to build and enhance from this base to reach maximum effectiveness of what the end result would look like! 

 Our developers will then evaluate these ideas and prioritize accordingly. This may depend on our team capacity, resources involved or alignment of feature request for strategic objectives to make sure soundness is achieved over all aspects and its integration does not introduce regressions into the code-base in any of its existing functionality modules and layers!

 To propose new ideas please make an issue describing everything clearly. This helps maintain clarity in our conversation for maintainers as a starting ground and enables discussion around possible implementation approaches which we appreciate as this helps with better integration into overall codebase to prevent potential future rework!

## 6. Pull Request Process

 Create a new branch starting from `main`. The naming standard of your branches will have format `<action>/<short description>` (example `feature/payment-system`). Make commits with meaningful changes with a good descriptive explanation as we are expecting - so the maintainers will better review and integrate the pull request accordingly for future integration.

 After making your contributions on top of the `feature/your-contribution-branch`, please make a pull request on top of it to the master and we shall evaluate the PR making any necessary requests and suggestions for final approval before we can merge this. We may even require more iterations if it doesn't satisfy requirements for approval to meet overall standards for integration into the master and for our overall team.

 The maintainers are responsible for evaluating your request for code review - they might make recommendations and suggestions for code cleanup for final acceptance. They would make some adjustments on a temporary fork so as those modifications don&#x27;t interfere in future development. We would be happy if we see great code and well tested functionalities and a smooth workflow in your PR submission so the merging is seamless in its flow,

 Once your pull request satisfies requirements and passes testing the team will be more comfortable accepting this to merge in main and we are very excited with what your addition will mean in the grand vision that we aim for our team to build together for years. Please note we are aiming high for a quality project! 

## 7. Coding Standards

 Our code strives to maintain uniformity that allows us and future users to understand it without issues - it helps us with debugging. Therefore our standards involve a strict and enforced set of guidelines to keep quality at high level!

 Code needs to follow PEP 8 standard as the main guideline and must also use descriptive meaningful comments that clearly communicate to any other reader on its implementation, intentions or what we're trying to achieve and avoid confusion on its logic in future maintenance steps of its code, or when refactoring in a team-effort stage,

  The `flake8` linting tool with configured config files helps with identifying any errors against standard PEP 8 convention or other coding best-practices for improved coding readability by everyone who contributes - we also make extensive uses of typing to improve the readability and reduce runtime error possibilities for all users to improve project's safety net,
 

   The project has pre-commit hooks for formatting changes and type-checking which are essential parts in our contribution process as we want the project for our future self. These will prevent issues being pushed into repository by auto checking code style standards as the changes occur - this will make all of contributions easier to maintain as everyone has access on our standard coding practices in our project's codebase. 

   The goal behind this process will help everyone involved with project to maintain code consistency that will ease the understanding, refactoring as well integration of features, which we want as a project and for anyone working within team collaborating simultaneously!

## 8. Testing Guidelines

 To contribute code we would want the project to maintain full and proper integration with automated testing, and therefore, please always make great attention in the code being well and thoroughly tested! 

 Run `pytest` to ensure all your contributions will function well in all stages! You must have Python set in PATH variable as we do require python to build test suites! Make any needed setup configurations on `pytest.ini` file,

 New test must adhere closely with the structure of tests in `tests/` directories so it maintains a clear structure with a modular testing design.  You might consider testing for boundary edge case situations, and for unexpected input as they could cause a major regression or security flaw down stream - always consider what could have been!

 Our team aims at comprehensive testing that can detect errors, so ensure unit tests cover each new function thoroughly! A full testing plan and integration should include edge cases that test the system under unusual stress situations to verify resilience!
 We would prefer the code in testable way with modular approach. So it helps developers maintain and understand code better for long period with future development stages. 

## 9. Documentation Contributions

 We encourage to enhance, add and maintain existing docstring as well - this helps everyone including developers, maintainers to understand code more and faster - it reduces learning barrier to get more developers engaged with contributions! Documentation are essential and important as code for a great and well-rounded software. 

 Please ensure the files reside at `./docs/` - all doc pages, and all documentation-related markdown pages. The project may require Sphinx configuration so that a build is done on top - it helps create an interactive and accessible format, so users require easy to consume docs that help them in any form and function with ease and quickness of learning the codebase in short time

 When updating existing documentation, please maintain clarity in its writing to ease any misunderstandings in users that are new - use clear language without jargon, or ambiguous descriptions - always consider your next developer and make your intentions clearly explained for them in documentation

   Please make your commits small to avoid merging difficulties or unexpected behaviors! It can happen when the commit changes everything at once - breaking our existing structure or causing other errors that were unnoticed in the merge stage of a big deletion, creation in large scope changes - so it is best kept smaller in nature to allow us all a chance! 

## 10. Commit Message Guidelines

 Every good team maintains their commit histories for tracking the progress that can allow us all developers or future team members understand and quickly identify changes that can resolve any issue that we might come across - commit history becomes vital!  

  Follow standard Conventional Commits for a clear description. It's a standard which uses prefix of commit like 'feat' (features), 'fix'( bug fixes) - and it enables a standardized approach with all teams and developers, that improves the communication!
 The commit message body explains *what* changed and *why*, which provides the team a valuable background context. The best commit histories help to quickly and clearly pinpoint where and when issues may originate or changes might happen. 

   Make great detail to write commit descriptions to avoid potential conflicts that are caused through poor commit practices which are hard to resolve - and it is very easy to cause issues when we lack clarity on why and what changes that were applied to existing system in the code, so please prioritize! 

## 11. Branching Model

 For simplicity we will stick to using standard trunk based flow and only create short live branches when there a lot going in. For all changes that will come we need you always branch out your feature on main to create separate environments that we're using and distributing, for testing! 

 The best convention would look as `feature/<your-contribution-feature-here>` or `fix/<bug-report>` - and make the naming convention consistent. We would love you using meaningful, but concise naming convention! 

 The purpose of these standards ensures clear tracking in development history so maintainers know where the work originated from in future stages when trying debug, refactor or even merge code into existing main branch for final distribution release

 For more details you can look into documentation on [this standard on github pages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), for full and comprehensive description to make our development streamlined for a team with consistent standards.

## 12. Review Process

 We maintainers would thoroughly look into and carefully inspect all PR's to provide feedback for iterative refinement that ensures all aspects satisfy standards. The PR will go through several cycles to allow maintainers the proper amount of quality check on every pull-requests that will enter main and merge for the team - please don not worry or rush into merging

   Feedback and comments might include coding best-practices recommendations. They will provide clarity about how the system will be best optimized with a modularized implementation, with clear and descriptive names! The goal of these steps allows to build and grow better codebase and make our product shine in a team-wide manner!
  Once approved we're excited that it meets overall requirements for acceptance! This is where maintainers will make merge with our codebase into existing and stable environment!
## 13. Communication Channels

 To check for the latest development changes or announcements feel free to connect to [our Slack Community Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/community_name). For critical issue reports we also utilize dedicated [GitHub Discussion Forum] to quickly reach out maintainers, which can help with rapid feedback and triage of issues - feel free and encouraged

 To communicate more formal suggestions on large architectural and design improvements, please create an [Issue in our public github repo]. This will keep our documentation organized in our repo so it becomes accessible to anyone who has interest for it.

  Our goal in all our team-work and collaboration stages - to foster positive and friendly and healthy community to help all members reach goals in development together for greater team performance. Let your opinions flow, ask any concerns, let us hear it to improve as community for best quality in product.

## 14. Security and Responsible Disclosure

 When encountering potential vulnerabilities and exploits that we must address immediately to protect against attacks, please make sure all information is handled securely to maintain a safe community, as well, as we all are!

 If you discover a possible security issue do *not* disclose in the issues section or public channel to help mitigate and prevent attacks before others might be impacted! Report vulnerabilities through [Security Team Contact form at contact_@projectname.org], with the detailed context for rapid response. 

 Maintain a confidential approach, helping with security audits before disclosing vulnerabilities and allow our developers adequate response timeframe to address the potential exploits, before public disclosure of the vulnerability so our product will continue serving with great protection and safe experience

 Our priority for this step is safety of project to all involved stakeholders including current customers - we are grateful to those involved helping us to build and create better products with more safety.
## 15. Release Process

 The current plan of actions is as simple, we will release every two months on specific days to provide new feature set - this can always change in case a large set of features and functionality would come out of the process, as that is an opportunity!

   Tag each stable version with [SemVer format]. Well organized tag system ensures a simple understanding in all version numbers. This also simplifies debugging for the entire development community!
 After each build our team prepares all release note to be posted in [our Github page release tab] which contains information regarding any updates that can impact existing code, or users who may interact on our current platform

 For a detailed explanation you can look through our detailed process that includes automated stages - [this document on Confluence] that details steps and best processes we hired to achieve high-value, and quality products that can reach high expectations for stakeholders!
## 16. Recognition

 To show appreciation we would like all active members in contributing - be added as maintainer or a recognized core team member! To make things fair everyone would be recognized by being featured on Github repo through contribution graphs achieved and contributions that are meaningful and important!
