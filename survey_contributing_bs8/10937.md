## Code of Conduct

Welcome!  We are committed to creating a positive and welcoming community.  All members, including contributors and maintainers must interact respectfully and thoughtfully.  We expect respectful and constructive dialogue, even (and *especially*) when discussing differences. Please read through the code for more details - we are all accountable.  

Any disrespectful or exclusionary behaviors are not tolerated. This includes harassing, discriminating, or demeaning any members of the team regardless of their background or contributions and is a serious breach of our shared community principles. If there is an incident, please contact any team manager immediately for resolution and support.

To foster open and inclusive environments and to protect the integrity of projects, this includes maintaining professional boundaries and adhering to respectful communication practices. Please read through our entire code, accessible within documentation or on our community portal for a complete overview of our values. We are dedicated to ensuring a safe and productive collaboration space for all involved. We are all committed to making this a wonderful environment to work in. 

## Getting Started

This section will cover basic information for contributors to quickly get their environments ready for working on this project.  To start your contribution, you' first needs to have Git set up and installed on your system.  Ensure that you also have your preferred command terminal or shell ready and able to run Git commands.

Clone the repository locally to your development machine. This will download a copy of the source code allowing you to make edits and changes. You can do this easily from your command line with this command:  
```bash 
git clone <repository_url>
```

Create a new branch named for the issue you're fixing / feature you're adding from within your newly checked out repo. A good branch name will start with a meaningful prefix to describe work like fix/ or feature/ . For more complex tasks, add a more granular description to the branch to easily understand its purpose:
```bash 
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

Before you start working, you must configure your Git user with valid information. The repository will not accept unconfirmed user commits, so you should set these values once before committing. Use your email and name for authentication:  
  ```git config --global user.email "your email.name@example.com"  
```

Install dependencies and setup development environment according local project requirements. You can typically install dependencies from your package management using commands such as:  
```bash
npm install || yarn install || pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a basic build and test to be sure all is working as intended. Use commands such as:
  ```  bash
  make build  || npm run build || yarn build  || ./gradlew build
```
   

Finally, familiarize yourself with existing code and documentation. Read the existing project documentation before jumping into any new work to gain a good foundation for what has been developed thus far and to better grasp any specific conventions used. This helps ensure a smoother and productive workflow for everyone involved - and helps you avoid re- inventing the (coding) wheel.  

## How to Contribute

This repository thrives on collaboration and open contributions. We encourage community members to report issues encountered, suggest innovative features, contribute code directly, and offer improvements to existing documentation to make this a better resource for our userbase. All these contributions are highly valued.

First off, before jumping in, please read through our existing tickets and documentation to avoid duplication of effort. Many issues have discussions or potential solutions, and your input might be best applied elsewhere, like helping improve an existing pull. Check to see if your idea is new or a duplicate and then engage the maintainers. It is much appreciated. 

Submitting a well-written pull request is the preferred method for submitting your code changes. Follow our branching rules, coding standards and ensure you pass all relevant tests and lint processes. You can also contribute by directly editing documentation or reporting bugs and suggestions. These forms of feedback are vital for the continued improvement of our platform.

Don't hesitate to engage in thoughtful discussions before you start implementing significant feature changes. A simple comment on the associated ticket can make a difference in how you approach the issue. The community is happy to provide suggestions or offer insights that can help refine your ideas, which leads to the best possible final solution and prevents rework.

Remember, even a small correction can significantly help! Every piece of input is appreciated, and we welcome any contribution towards making this better and stronger. Your work has a positive impact - join the collaborative journey! We are a growing family and we are thrilled you chose to join our team!   

## Reporting Bugs

Before creating a new bug report or issue, it is best practices to first search the current open issues and existing bug tracking to ensure you' not simply recreating a report that is already being worked on. Please take a moment to ensure your submission is not a duplicate!

A detailed and reproducible bug report is invaluable for our ability to efficiently diagnose and correct issues. Include as much context and information as you have about what you did, expected behavior, and actual behavior observed. Providing specific versions and configurations of the system you ran into this problem. 

To help with reproducibility, provide the steps required to consistently reproduce the problem. This makes it easier to verify your findings as well. Also, providing a small, self-contained example that showcases the bug is the absolute best thing you could do - consider making that part of the issue report. 

Report bugs and other issues through the [GitHub Issues](https://github .com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO /issues) page. Clearly label the issue with an appropriate tag (e.g., " bug", "enhancement", "documentation"). A clear and well formed report helps our developers to solve the bugs more quickly! 

## Suggesting Enhancements

We're always eager to improve our project! If you have suggestions or ideas to enrich this repository, please do not hesitate to share them. New feature ideas and improvements are welcome at any contribution stage. Please follow the steps outlined below when proposing new enhancements. Please read through our open suggestions first! 

When suggesting enhancements please provide a compelling explanation. A good explanation will describe the feature, its benefits, and how it would positively impact the users or project. Consider including the context or scenario of how this enhancement will come into play. It is helpful to provide potential use cases for your proposed enhancement.

We appreciate you providing clear and detailed explanations for your proposed enhancements. These explanations assist our developers to grasp the scope and benefits. Please share your ideas either through GitHub Issues by adding the relevant tag ("enhancement"), or by engaging directly with the project maintainers on our designated discussion channels. Your contributions help steer our platform toward continued excellence!    

## Pull Request Process

Our contribution workflow is primarily conducted via pull requests. This method allows for collaborative code review and ensures that all changes meet our project standards prior to integration. Please read these guidelines to submit successful PRs.

When you're ready to contribute, fork our repository and make all modifications in your fork. Once you've made your modifications and they are all ready, create a new branch named according to the task you were working on. Branch names should be descriptive and easily understandable:
```bash
     git branch -b feature/implement-new-api 
```

Submit a Pull Request (PR ) to our main project from your newly created branch. Please provide a detailed description, linking the relevant issue number(s) and outlining the changes made. Include a clear title and a descriptive explanation outlining your changes.

Our maintainers will review your changes, which includes checking for correctness, code style adherence, and compliance with testing standards. They may also suggest revisions. Engage in discussions, address feedback constructively and push your new modifications. Once approved, your PRs are incorporated into our main codebase and your contributions will be acknowledged!

## Coding Standards

Maintain project consistency by adhering to these code standards. We strive for clarity, readability, and maintainability throughout codebase. This includes proper naming conventions, consistent formatting, and adherence to our coding styles to create clean and robust code.

Use 4 spaces for indentation, avoid tabs, and follow the established naming scheme for variables, functions, and other code elements. We also encourage comments to clarify complex and/ or ambiguous areas of your code - a well commented code can go a long way! Keep it concise and relevant to its functionality or logic.

We strongly recommend using a l Inter, type checker, or other linting tools to enforce coding standards automatically. You will be required to pass the required lint processes before pull requests can be accepted. Configure these tools to run with each code modification. These tools help prevent common errors and ensure adherence to coding standards automatically. 

## Testing Guidelines

Thorough testing is crucial for the stability and reliability of our project. To ensure high-quality code, you' re required to test any newly added components, fixes or modifications.  This includes creating tests to cover new code and updating existing tests when needed to reflect changes.

Before submitting your PR, ensure all existing tests are passing using the provided test commands: `npm test`, or `pytest`, or `make test` depending on the project's build system and configurations. If tests fail, address them before submitting your PR. A comprehensive test suite demonstrates the reliability and correctness of your code additions!

Write unit, integration, and regression tests to provide comprehensive coverage. Unit tests verify functionality for individual components, integration tests assess the interactions between modules, and regression tests verify functionality is not adversely affected. A good test coverage is important for project stability and quality!

## Documentation Contributions

Well- maintained documentation is key to making this project accessible and user- friendly for a larger audience! Please contribute to our documentation whenever you find errors, gaps, or outdated information. This improves the usefulness of our projects across the user community.

All of our core documentation, like the API reference, tutorials, and guides, are stored in `docs/` directory. Edit files directly using your favorite code editor, follow the existing documentation style, and ensure consistency across all documentation. Be clear and concise while explaining concepts and functionality - a user should not feel overwhelmed or lost reading your work! 

When submitting your PRs with documentation changes, be sure to describe your modifications and explain the reasoning behind the edits. This helps maintainers assess the improvements and ensures that the documentation is accurate and relevant. Documentation is an integral part - do not overlook!      

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a specific convention when creating commits - this helps our maintain and community members better understand the changes. Use clear, descriptive, and grammatically correct messages to describe changes made in each commit to facilitate a clear and concise audit trail. 

Use the Conventional Commits format to ensure consistency and ease of parsing. Start your commit message with a type prefix (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`) followed by a concise subject line that summarizes the change and its intent: `feat: Add login page.`   Please ensure a single action verb and use imperative mood in each line (eg:  "Fix broken build" instead of "Fixed broken build").

The message body, should provide more detailed context for your commit and any related discussions, if relevant. Separate the subject line from the body with a blank line, which will improve readability. Following consistent standards improves team collaboration - thank you for adhering!   

## Branching Model

To facilitate development without disruption to main project line, we adopt a [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/git-flow-workflow) branching model with slight customization to accommodate specific team processes. We are dedicated to a robust version and quality-control approach across every step!

All developers work off their personal or task specific branches to keep a separation between stable production code, experimental and active work in progress, or testing and bug fixes, for increased project integrity. Always branch from a branch, rather than a branch from `main`. It ensures changes do not interfere.

We generally use feature branches with naming like: `feature/some-amazing-feature`, `fix/bug-report-3589` or  `chore/dependency-upgrade`. For longer tasks or feature work requiring multiple sprints we suggest you use an `epic/name-of-work`. Properly using these helps with organization.      

## Review Process

Our project maintains a strict quality gate to protect project and user interests - this involves rigorous peer and maintainer reviews to assess code quality and overall correctness and alignment with requirements. Think this ensures high levels of stability.  Please expect a prompt turnaround for initial review. However delays do happen - do not get discouraged if this takes more time!

Provide feedback on PRs within [two to three business days]. Provide clear and constructive explanations. When rejecting an idea explain clearly to avoid misunderstanding!  We value a productive discussion that improves outcomes for everyone involved - please contribute positively and respectfully!

## Communication Channels

We are always seeking opportunities to grow community and to provide channels of communication and feedback! For immediate support you may use Slack, and Discord or GitHub's built in discussion forum for less pressing requests and longer feedback loops.   For deeper and technical conversations, our community Slack channel `#[community-project]`. 

Our dedicated GitHub repository's discussion tab, where project-related announcements, open topics, community discussions are shared: [Discussion Forum Link]. We value an inclusive approach so please be sure that everyone can engage respectfully - do no be a disruptive element in a productive team effort.   
## Security and Responsible Disclosure

Your contributions should consider security as well! Please take extra measures in reviewing new submissions, testing for security risks before integrating changes - proactive risk-mitigation protects our project users!   We value secure code practices and will review and address concerns promptly - please reach out with confidence, no questions or issues left unturned!

When a potential vulnerability or security incident arises, we require the reporting in confidential manner, through the security channels before a broader, and more potentially public, dissemination. You can use a designated mailing alias: `security`.   We value the protection of user privacy! 
 
## Release Process

To release and ship new functionality to production our releases happen with specific tagging procedures - and this includes the generation of change log summaries for documentation for version updates. We value transparency so the community is updated for any and all version release events and milestones reached during project delivery - it builds and creates confidence among stakeholders.

When we create release candidates or versions we adhere closely to Semantic Versioning principles which are used across all versions and release events for consistency: https://semver.org/. Our project will follow strict standards. This will improve clarity on versioning and help developers and community members easily understand changes made!   


## Recognition

To express sincere appreciation to contributors for all contributions of work to the projects we publicly maintain a contributors file in a special folder. Contributors may choose to add an optional photo or avatar in their profiles to make this process personal for all stakeholders. Contributors receive a mention for their effort as the projects progress to ensure the team and their dedication are recognized as it progresses towards greater and larger accomplishments.      

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This section should explain whether the project uses a Contributor License Agreement and outline it for transparency and to build trust amongst users! We will use standard license, which requires explicit agreements on ownership for work contributed and copyrights associated and how the contribution can and may be legally and ethically be applied to a broader audience for benefit!
