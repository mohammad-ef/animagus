We are excited to grow our open contribution base.  We value your insights and efforts. Your contributions will play a vital role! We encourage collaboration and welcome everyone to contribute.

We believe that contributions from a variety of perspectives lead to greater innovation and more reliable code, which ultimately serves our users more reliably and comprehensively.  Whether you are a technical expert or simply have ideas to make us better and accessible, we welcome you to join us. This is a community-oriented and inclusive project - let's keep it that way!  We appreciate any help and value all feedback. 

We also encourage you to contribute outside of code! This may mean updating documentation, suggesting improvements, or even spreading the project around. Let this guide assist you in making the best contributions you can! Thank you for considering contributing, the project appreciates every bit of input.

## Code and Conduct

We value a supportive and friendly community, and we want everyone to feel welcome and safe participating. We expect every maintainer or member to be open, welcoming and inclusive of everyone. Please treat everyone with empathy - be friendly, courteous, and mindful of how your words may be perceived. 

Discussions, feedback or suggestions that may be critical or critical to the functionality or performance of code, is not only acceptable but desired. Constructive critiques are welcomed. But do so thoughtfully to make your intentions as clear to other maintain or developers as possible. 

Harassment or any form of disrespectful communication will absolutely not be taken lightly. If we find you are disrupting the team or community, your contribution access may be removed or restricted. We are committed to providing a respectful environment.  For more details, please also consult our full [Link to Code of Conduct]. If you have concerns or see someone in distress please contact the project maintainers. 

## Getting Started

To get started on our community, you will likely begin setting up an environment locally in which development is possible and easy. This involves installing a few tools. If you are not familiar with using command line tools you may find it useful to learn some fundamentals about it.

First, you will need [List required software like Python, Node.js, Go, etc., and version recommendations]. You can typically obtain these with your platform manager. After the main environment is in order then clone the [Project Repo] into a directory. This directory will now house the code you will begin interacting with. The command to clone is as simple as: `git clone [Project Repo] `.

Before you start developing or running any code, be absolutely certain you' ve run `npm install` in the project root. This command will install all dependencies for the project. After you have successfully completed the installation, you can run the code with the command `[build and launch command].`

Next create new branches for your contributions. It' a common best practice. This isolates contributions for later consideration. It also prevents accidental integration of unstable or un-reviewed functionality and code. You will use commands like `git checkout -b feature/MyFeature`. This ensures you are working on a feature branch.

## How to Contribute 

We encourage contributors of all skill levels to become a part of the community. The [Project Name] welcomes a wide variety of contributions.  From writing code to improving documentation, there are many ways you can help shape this project. We' ll be glad to work with new developers to guide you through our processes.  

If you've come across a bug, please report it! If there is a new function you wish to be added or improved, please share! All contributions are valued in making the project grow and thrive.

To contribute, it is best to first review the current open issues on GitHub. This allows you to understand where the most critical work currently is. Look at the issues marked as [label] which are open, but do not yet have a developer or assigned maintainer. If you'd like to tackle one of these please let an appropriate maintain know before commencing. 

We also encourage you all to communicate with the project developers, or the project maintain as you develop. This ensures everyone is on the same page. Discussing your approach can help ensure you are following standards and avoid unnecessary rework or conflicts. We are happy to collaborate!

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug (an unexpected behavior or error), please let us know. A well-written bug report significantly helps us to understand and reproduce the issue. Please be specific and detailed. This will allow for quick and simple resolutions! 

Your bug report needs the following elements. A good bug report needs these elements to allow for quick reproduction, and simple resolutions! First you must describe the behavior that you'd be anticipating versus what happened in a concise way. Secondly it is vital to describe the version of [Project Name] and dependencies. This will help identify environment or platform incompatibilities.

Finally, include steps to reproduce the issue. The simplest possible steps are best to avoid confusion. It' is important to create a reproducible example - a minimal code snippets or scenario that consistently produces the bug.  This dramatically simplifies debugging and allows for efficient verification of fixes. Submit it through [Link to the Issue Tracker on GitHub or similar].

It would also be beneficial to include any error messages and logs that occurred while you were trying to reproduce the issue. This information is often crucial in diagnosing root causes and resolving the bug efficiently. 

## Suggesting Enhancements

We love ideas for improving [Project Name]! If you have a suggestion, we encourage you to share it.  Your input can help shape the project's future direction and make the project even better for others. If you have ideas about how the project could become more efficient please let us know. 

A good request includes a clear explanation of the proposed feature. Explain what you want to happen and, if possible, provide context to the current function of the project. A brief explanation of how a feature would be utilized is also important - how might it be helpful? 

Describe the benefits of adding the enhancement. Why would this feature be useful or beneficial to the user? What problems does it solve?  Providing motivation helps us prioritize feature requests and evaluate their potential impact. We use this to prioritize.  

Before implementing, create a new issue on GitHub to describe your ideas.  This allows us to engage in a discussion and refine the proposal. This ensures alignment. We may have alternative or better solutions. If a feature is deemed valuable it will likely be added in the release pipeline. 

## Pull Requests

Pull Request or PRs are how your code is integrated into the project! To submit a PR you must follow our standards to ensure smooth merges to the main development branch. 

Start by creating a new branch in your local repository using the format [prefix]/[description], like `feature/add-new-functionality` or `fix/incorrect-variable name`, where the prefix can be `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, ` chore` and `perf`. Then make all your changes, ensuring they adhere to the established coding standards and pass all existing tests.

Make sure your commit messages are clear and concise. Each commit should represent a discrete and logically complete change.  Use the [Conventional Commits specification (see below)]. When you' are satisfied your code meets our guidelines, push your branch to your repository. You can then submit a pull request through GitHub.

The pull requests will undergo review process by one or more maintainers. They'll check for code quality, adherence to guidelines, and functionality. If feedback is received be prepared to iterate on the contribution based upon the feedback given by maintainers to align with the projects guidelines.  Once everything is good and all tests pass the PR's will be merged and released to the community.

## Coding Standards

Consistent code style significantly enhances readability, maintainability, and collaboration.  Please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing code. These guidelines are designed to keep the code uniform across all contributions. 

We utilize [Linter] to automatically enforce style rules. You must run these to verify code before you push changes. This will ensure you are aligned with all of the coding practices within this project. We will likely require you have these installed locally to avoid unnecessary back- and-forth.

All code must be well-documented and have a good amount of comments to aid in comprehension and debugging purposes. Comments are a critical component of good code, so be sure you add them appropriately. This can be in the form of docstrings, in-line comments, function documentation, and other helpful notes for other developers.

Type annotations are highly encouraged where feasible to increase code clarity and prevent unexpected errors. We are working toward full static typing. This may mean adding type checks or static type checking into the pipeline. 

## Tests

Testing helps ensure the project's reliability and stability. It allows us to verify all functionality of the project is operating as intended.

We have an existing suite of tests covering many aspects of the application. It is vital that all new or modified code includes comprehensive tests. Before submitting, please ensure all tests are still passing. This helps prevent regressions.

Our tests use the framework [Specify Testing Framework - e.g., Jest or Mocha].  You need familiarity with this framework to write good code that can be integrated. You should aim to write unit tests to verify the individual components, integration tests to check how modules interact, and regression tests to catch unintended side effects. 

## Contribution Guidelines

Improving and updating documentation is just as valuable as writing code. It helps users get the most out it.

Documentation is primarily stored in the [Specify the file and folder structure for documentation] directories. The documentation includes user guides, tutorials, API reference, and developer documentation. 

When contributing documentation, be clear and consistent with our standards. Use markdown formatting. Be sure all links and references in the updated documentation are accurate. Ensure there aren't any typos or grammatical errors. 

## Commit Message Guidelines

Clear and descriptive commit messages are essential for maintaining a well organized project history. 

Each commit message should have a short (5 to 10 words) summary followed by a blank line, and then an optional more detailed explanation. The summary should clearly explain what the commit does.  The detailed explanation can provide context, motivation, or any relevant information. 

We encourage contributors to use conventional commits. Conventional commits use a standardized format to categorize and describe changes. The conventional commit format starts with a type prefix (e g. `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`), followed by a colon and a descriptive summary. 

## Branching Model

This project uses the [Specify the chosen branching strategy, e.g. Gitflow] branching model. This structure enables parallel development, isolation of features, and easier management of releases.

For new features, you should branch off of [Specify the base branch e.g., `develop` or `main `]. This helps ensure all contributions can easily be integrated. For bug fixes branch off of [Specify the base branch e.g. `main`]. 

When you finish developing a new branch then merge it in the proper branch. 

## Code Review Process

All pull requests will be reviewed carefully by the maintainers before merging. The review is to ensure code quality, adherence to the coding standards, and functionality. 

The maintain team will provide feedback on your PR. They may have suggestions for changes to make the code more robust, maintainable or efficient. Be prepared to make these requested changes. This is a chance to learn!

Once the code meets all the requirements, the maintainers will merge the pull request. The contribution will then be integrated into the project. 

## Communication Channels

We use several channels to communicate within the community. If you have questions, need help, or have a suggestion, feel encouraged to reach out. 

We encourage you to create issues on GitHub if you're having difficulty, or if there's a problem with functionality or a need for additional assistance. 

We've set up [Forum name, chat or Slack]. We are happy to engage you with a team there, should there be more specific requests. This platform may allow you for immediate feedback from a developer. 

## Security

The [Project Name] values the security of the platform.  Please ensure to engage and communicate safely!

We appreciate reports about potential security vulnerabilities but strongly request without disclosure or exposure in open or shared environments. 

Report any discovered vulnerabilities directly to [Specify Contact or Email] with clear, and concise description to allow prompt resolution.

## Release

The releases and distribution cycles occur regularly as new changes or functionality has been merged and validated within the codebase. This happens automatically!

When you merge the code it is automatic tagged for distribution purposes, as a release cycle for the product will occur shortly after.

The change logs are updated as changes and functionality come out so be certain to consult the changes logs on [Github Repository] for up to date info.
