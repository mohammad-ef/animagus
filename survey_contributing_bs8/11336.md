# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions of any kind are welcomed, regardless of experience level! We believe that a strong community builds a stronger project. Your contributions can range from fixing typos in documentation to tackling major features - all valuable and much appreciated.

This project relies on community contributions to stay current, robust, and user-friendly for everyone. Every bug fixed, test written, or enhancement proposed makes a difference and directly supports our users and goals. Join us in making this a great software!

We encourage both technical and non-technical contributions.  Good design decisions, clear explanations, and thoughtful discussion all help shape the best possible outcomes. Let' focus all contributions on being collaborative and constructive in order to benefit everyone.

 ## 1. Code of Conduct

We are a supportive, respectful, inclusive community. Every participant, regardless of skillset, ethnicity, gender, identity, or anything else, has the right to a positive and collaborative experience here.

Harassment, bullying, or any kind of disrespectful behavior is not tolerated. We want everyone to feel comfortable contributing without fear of judgment or discrimination. Please adhere to our values to ensure a safe place to build software with all.

If you experience or see something that is not aligned with our Code of Conduct, please report it. The issue should be addressed by maintain contributors. The project maintains the authority to immediately exclude anyone whose behavior is considered disruptive and/or disrespectful to the team.

## 2. Getting Started

First, you'll obviously need a GitHub account. If that's covered, please fork the repository to your GitHub account. Cloning your for into your workspace and set up is the following steps.

Next, make sure you have the prerequisites installed: a suitable environment, such as Python 3.  You may also need Node or a version of Java for specific build steps depending on the technology. Make sure your tool versions match the requirements defined in the project's `requirements.txt` or similar file.

Once you've cloned the repository to your local machine, run `npm install` within the directory to manage dependencies.  The build instructions (e g. `make`, `gradle build`, or similar commands) is found in `README.md` and/or associated build system documentation.

Create a new branch for your changes.  It is critical to branch off of the `main `(or sometimes `develop `) to isolate your changes. Use a descriptive branch name like `fix/typo-in-readme` or  `feature/add-search-functionality`.

Finally, after you make changes in branch, run a `git pull origin main` (or develop) to ensure you are up-to-date before beginning your local changes.

## 3. How to Contribute

We welcome many ways you can help with this project.  From fixing typos to contributing significant new features, all contributions are appreciated.

Reporting issues is the easiest first step. Clear and concise bug reports, feature requests or improvement requests helps us quickly understand and prioritize the tasks at hand. Please read the section " Reporting Bugs " below. 

Suggesting new enhancements is also a great contribution. If you find something that could make the project better, don’t hesitate to submit a suggestion. Read the section " Suggesstions for Enhancements". We encourage discussions before starting large features to prevent wasted effort.

Improving documentation is a vital and often overlooked contribution! Keeping documentation clear, up-to-date, and accurate greatly increases its usefulness. If documentation can use clarity and consistency then contribute it!. Submitting a Pull Request to fix a problem and implement it!

## 4. Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug, search the existing issues on GitHub to avoid duplicates. It can sometimes reveal the root of your bug and potential solution or a similar issue to resolve with the project's support.

Provide a clear and concise title summarizing the issue, for clarity in future references and search. A good descriptive error messages can can also greatly simplify debugging and resolving a problem so that's always valuable for reporting the issue!

Please include steps to reproduce the bug, including input values and expected versus actual results. Include relevant error messages or logs that will provide valuable details on a given error that helps developers quickly identify its causes and resolve.

To help developers identify the context in the project to address this problem quickly include your environment and configuration settings, which can include things such as version, platform, operating system or other details. Submit the issue through the project 's GitHub issue tracker.

## 5. Suggesting Enhancements

Before proposing an enhancement, make sure there isn`t already a similar feature request or suggestion made by another. Review the existing open or closed suggestions as there can often already be solutions that address an area needing change or addition to functionality.

When submitting a suggestion, please include a detailed description, a motivation for its importance, and some concrete use cases demonstrating its benefit and value in real life implementation or functionality use. Explain why this is necessary now and how the enhancement addresses this requirement and provides the benefit.

Enhancements go through review and prioritize process by the maintainers and team based on complexity, alignment with the project goal, resource availability, user interest and the number of potential user.  It can takes weeks for review, testing and integration with an established and growing system so plan and set your expectation on response.

Please provide feedback as to any of its features if any once you have had some opportunity to try. This allows you provide additional information or suggestions to enhance the functionality further and to make improvements in future implementations of it!. We appreciate you feedback!

## 6. Pull Request Process

Create a new branch based on `main `or, sometimes, `develop`. Adopt branch names with meaningful and informative description, which is using a prefix of `feature/<your-feature>` for features or `fix/<your-bugfix>` when working on correcting existing functionality, etc...

When making code updates in your feature- or bug-branch write concise descriptive commit messages, adopting standard practices and conventions for code commit. Then submit the Pull Request on GitHub, with an adequate and informative description and reference issue, if necessary..

The PR goes through automated code testing using CI ( Continuous Integration and deployment and/or linting tools for quality assessment to prevent issues with the integration). Once it has been passed and review comments from core contributor are resolved as appropriate it then goes through manual quality control checks..

## 7. Coding Standards

We follow industry-best practices. Adhering to them leads to a cohesive, readable, and maintainable codebase and is expected of all developers to help ensure the highest possible standards are adhered to at all times..

Our preferred code styling is defined via [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) when working with Python. The team enforces coding rules using linters configured using flake8 with the proper settings defined within .flake8 or .config/pre-commit file and tools to automate style check during PR creation..

Use docstrings.  Document the intent, inputs and behavior, as they are the backbone of our automated systemic and automated functionality, as such documentation standards help in the maintenance..

Code reviews happen before every PR gets merged to main . Maintain code standards for better readability for developers to easily work on and collaborate effectively on. This promotes a consistent project and ensures all team is up to code standards to help resolve conflicts or misunderstandings

## 8. Testing Guidelines

All contributed code should have adequate testing for functionality and robustness with existing patterns. We encourage unit tests that are targeted towards specific functions or modules as core components, and integration tests, where multiple units interact as a complete and cohesive component and a higher level.

Existing test files should be reviewed so we understand how software functionality and interactions can work, so they can then easily be expanded to ensure quality of new components.. The tests run in continuous build systems (such as CircleCI) with tests passing and running as an automatic gatekeeper with every Pull Request before merging.

When you write test use pytest framework as the testing library. Follow adequate coding styles within the existing test file as the testing library and standards are defined within project resources..  Add as much code coverage as is reasonable and expected in a real implementation to avoid bugs from arising

## 9. Documentation Contributions

Documentation is located in the `docs/` directory, often using tools like Sphinx for creating structured output, or in README as markdown to describe and guide user. If the tool changes it can automatically regenerate and refresh as needed and maintain quality for everyone!

If the project follows any specific coding conventions, make the appropriate edits. Be concise, informative, and follow existing coding standard practices and documentation standards within your contributions and documentation updates! If there exists style guide and formatting then follow that.

Please make any needed adjustments for the documentation. This should include things that ensure documentation matches code or any API or other logic in your changes.. Consistency helps maintain and improves user adoption of the tool

## 10. Commit Message Guidelines

Every commit needs descriptive text for developers to clearly understand changes for easy integration or future debugging purposes!. We adhere to semantic versioning for commits. Shorter is not better as descriptive commits help with understanding and collaboration in development

Follow a convention, like "feat: Add support for authentication.", with `feat `denoting the added component, a colon for clear formatting purposes then describe functionality, "fix: Resolve a critical performance problem in data ingestion process ". These prefixes will enable tooling support and help in automated tooling such a CHANGELOG generator,

The body needs to be descriptive of why it needed the functionality or why it has changed with details as needed but keep to succinct description. A single sentence or multiple sentence description, that provides clarity and understanding for others will go far in ensuring maintainability. 

## 11. Branching Model

The main branching workflow used is a modified GitFlow where development takes place off `main `(which protects from unintended direct changes), with features on branches created and then merges when the functionality passes QA/Testing requirements

The primary branch for new work to branch off should ideally start with either the main and/or dev branches, and use prefix of such such feature or fixes with meaningful branch description such as "feature/my-great-idea ".  It can also create branches with a specific version such a "version_2/bugfix-x".

Avoid directly branching onto release or `main ` branches unless there's urgent need as such actions could destabilize or create integration or deployment risks.. The downstream integration can also create unexpected changes that will be very problematic if direct commits.

## 12. Review Process

Pull requests will undergo peer reviews as well to check and assess all proposed changes and make recommendations if templates don;t fit and/or cause issues or errors, with comments to address any potential concerns with suggestions as possible fixes..  Always check to resolve the issues or suggestions with the review process!

Response to any comments on any changes or issues should come to prompt, so all code reviews will have adequate turnaround to maintain project flow with a 24 hours turnaround for all review comments is the standard expectation! The project is a collective with collaboration in its design!.

Once PR has successfully passes the automated testing checks the quality control checks as defined with automated linting or testing it is deemed suitable and is reviewed again.. Merging is approved upon satisfactory recursive and thorough code analysis of quality and standards of development!.

## 13. Communication Channels

Discussions can be carried in our community discord or the issue threads and discussions. These can also allow direct conversations with core team developers and stakeholders..

Please respect other and engage respectfully on community threads as we encourage all members of a positive team. Please follow our community guidelines for positive interactions.. If a critical situation arise and cannot be adequately communicated over discord then email maintain developers for a timely resolve.

We are a team who welcomes and encourages all contributions as the effort to improve project is the main driving objective of development, which allows the development to continue in positive ways!. Join in the discussions!

## 14. Security and Responsible Disclosure

If you suspect or confirm security vulnerabilities or any code exploits and vulnerabilities within code you are welcome to privately email the developers at secure[at]company_example to report. Please do not publicly discuss any such details, vulnerabilities in public venues such as social or discussion groups, so we resolve that.

Maintain security posture, so the development should focus resolving any security risks. Do a scan to identify security vulnerabilities to resolve as part of code improvements and/or updates, security patches, so as we continue to enhance software!
  

## 15. Release Process

Version control uses semver as a release model (e.g., version major.minor.patch with appropriate documentation and version management). Version updates can happen every quarter or at an applicable release schedule!. Release candidates may occur before release.
      
Release preparation includes thorough review of code, updating version files in source, creating changelist of changes for version notes. Then build is done using build artifact tools, packaged and tested to confirm stability of build for all releases!.   Deployment steps should always include testing, running checks to confirm stability, as it can sometimes impact the production system
       
Tag all released code within version control so all versions and changes in code history are tracked properly!. It can be automated through deployment scripts as part of automated tooling to track and manage the code versions!
      

## 16. Recognition

Contributoins and code updates are tracked and displayed for transparency. Contributor's will show on README page or other publicly visible locations!. Maintain code, design documentation to track the contribution as part of our commitment and community support 

## 17. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

If this license model will affect contribution to software, please submit and agree the terms of contribution before merging to maintain the project and all rights for software, which allows developers flexibility to contribute and improve software!. Please follow guidelines for the agreement to proceed with any contribution and ensure alignment.

## 18. Resources and References

The primary code standards used for Python projects are defined using pep 8 as a coding practice for the style to make maintainability and understanding the standards easy and intuitive, for better developer adoption!. 
          
For testing the project adopts and encourages to follow practices of [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/) so testing standards for integration of the software is well aligned.. This helps maintain consistency.
           
Reference to style, standards for all contributions will ensure project can maintain consistent quality across the development life cycle for the product to ensure the project can continue and grow!.
