# Contributors Guildines for Acme Project

## 1. Introduction

This project is more than just source code; it is the collective endeavor and passion of a global community of engineers and creators. We are committed in making the experience seamless by encouraging everyone to be part of building, refining, and maintaining the code, and documentation that empowers our community. We encourage anyone from anywhere in timezones, backgrounds, genders, races to join.   

Contributing to the development of the Acme Project, means directly impactting the lives of those benefiting from its usage and capabilities. Your expertise, insights, and dedication, whether it' s a minor code tweak or major functionality, contributes to the continued success of the Acme Ecosystem as a whole.    

We value contributions that help us maintain a high bar of quality, documentation, and accessibility. This can extend to improving our tests as much improving features, documentation, or bug fixes. Your engagement helps to create something bigger than each of ourselves. We encourage non-coding contributions like improving readability, accessibility or helping to organize. Let’s work together to build something amazing!

## 2. Code of Conduct

We want to ensure an accessible, collaborative, and positive open source journey for contributors. Everyone interacting with the project, whether in code, documentation, communication, and community, should be respectful toward all participants to maintain a friendly, constructive environment.

We expect contributors to be considerate, welcoming in their interactions. Please avoid offensive or disparaging language, and treat every other member with a baseline of kindness. If a situation requires it, address conflicts privately and professionally, seeking guidance if you need help with that approach.

Inappropriate behavior, including harassment (whether sexual, personal, or otherwise ), discrimination, and offensive communication, and will not tolerated, in any context and will not be excused under any circumstances. Repeated violations of these standards may lead to a ban from the project, as well as a formal reporting to our community leadership.

Respect, and a positive approach to all participants, is the bedrock of our open source ethos; it is our shared expectation, our mutual benefit and a reflection of the values that bind us and drive our shared goal.

## 3. Getting Started

To get started, it helps to set up the environment. First and foremost, it' the best to familiarize ourselves with our repo on the cloud, typically using GitHub (e g, forking, creating an accout if you do not have one). Clone down the relevant repository, so you have the files to work with. 

Once it is downloaded onto your machine, you' will likely want to install any needed prerequisites. Typically the `INSTALL.md file`, which should be included in the repo, provides details regarding dependencies such as Python, Javascript and required libraries. Please read through the file before continuing.  

Branching rules are crucial. When you have forked and cloned your own copy of the repository, create separate local branches for individual features or bug fixes. Name the branches following a convention such as: feature/new-feature, fix/bugfix and docs/documentation updates. Do not work directly on main.

Next, build the software using the project setup instructions.  This may mean executing the `npm install` (for frontend) or `setup.py install` ( for backends) commands, which installs all the required dependencies. The specific installation and build processes will vary depending on the codebase, so it' important to follow any provided instructions precisely.

## 4. How to Contribute

There are many ways to get involved!  We appreciate any help improving the project, regardless of expertise. You might find yourself fixing bugs, adding new features, or helping with documentation and providing guidance, and we would appreciate any assistance that can get us closer together. 

We also encourage you to submit suggestions for new features and improvements to enhance the user experience, expand functionality or add support, as well improving testing coverage across the project, and making documentation accessible across the community as well. We are always looking for feedback, and new ideas and directions.

Before starting a significant implementation, consider discussing the changes with other contributors. This will help identify potential pitfalls, and also align the changes with the goals and direction of project. Creating a new issue or engaging in discussion threads on the project's communication channels, like Discord and Slack, may prove effective.    

We welcome improvements to the documentation as much as we do bug fixes, so feel free submit any improvements you deem to be relevant for improving clarity and understanding across the ecosystem of our software and users. We are also always open to suggestions from our users, and the best way is to file a suggestion as a GitHub discussion.   

To report an issue, go to the "Issues" page within your forked repo and submit a detailed report describing the bug. For new features, open a "Feature Request" issue, providing as much information as possible. To create documentation, edit the existing documentation.   

 

   

## 5. Reporting Bugs

When submitting a new issue, please make your report as descriptive as possible, with a detailed explanation, and a link to GitHub if applicable, to provide context. It is best to provide a detailed, reproducible, clear, and step-by-step instructions.

A clear title is also a key component of your issue, and it should concisely describe the bug in an easily identifiable, clear language that can be quickly and directly read. Please ensure you are providing as much detail as necessary, which should allow our team to fully understand the scope of issues and resolve them quickly.

When reporting a bug, ensure you are checking that the issue has not yet been raised by a contributor before submitting a new issue. A thorough check of the issue tracker on the repository can help eliminate duplicates.

Finally, to aid the reproduction of the issue, consider adding a log file, if applicable for your specific case. A log provides valuable debugging information that can assist the developers in resolving the issue, as it can often highlight specific areas for further investigation as a starting point.    

## <font color="red "> **All issues and documentation must contain a title to be properly addressed** 

<hr color="blue ">
## 6. Suggesting Enhancements

We are committed to the continuous improvement of the Acme Project, and we welcome ideas for new features and enhancements. To submit a well-formed and well-considered enhancement request:

First, open a new "Feature Request" issue, providing a clear, succinct, and comprehensive explanation of the enhancement, its intended purpose, and potential user benefits. Please provide a detailed explanation, including any potential use cases for this functionality.    

Second, consider including a mock-up, diagrams, or any other visual aids that can help illustrate the idea and facilitate a common understanding with the rest of the contributors and core team. This can be a useful way for developers to grasp the concept.

Our maintainers carefully review all feature requests, considering their alignment with project goals, feasibility, and potential for broad user adoption before moving them into the pipeline for prioritization or implementation.  We' will provide updates on their progress within a reasonable timeframe, keeping our users and community apprised.    

Finally, remember, all enhancements must adhere to existing guidelines, so it is critical to align with project standards, so the integration will prove seamless and consistent with the existing code, and architecture.  

## <font color="red "> **Feature suggestions must include a detailed description, potential use cases, and mockups** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 7. Pull Request Process

To submit a pull request, make sure you have branched using:
 ```bash
 git checkout - b feature/branch-name
  ```
Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages. After committing, push the code from your feature branch to the fork.

Next, create a new pull request from your fork's branch to the Acme main or development branch. Write a detailed pull request description, outlining the intended functionality, the changes made, and any potential impact on existing features or the broader ecosystem.

Our maintain team reviews each PR thoroughly for style, functionality, and adherence to the established standards. They may provide feedback to improve the solution or identify potential issues. Please be receptive to their feedback, addressing issues and iterating on your code as necessary, so the integration will prove seamless and consistent with the existing ecosystem.

Following a successful review, including automated testing, the PR will be merged into the project, incorporating its contributions and extending its reach within the larger Acme universe to the wider world.     

## <font color="red "> **PRs must be merged following code and testing review from all stakeholders**     

<hr color="blue ">

## 8. Coding Standards

We adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for Python, and the Google JavaScript Style Guide for JavaScript. These standards promote code readability and consistency, and contribute to a maintainable base of code. We encourage the use of code linters (flake8 for Python and ESLint for JavaScript) that ensure code follows the established guidelines.

To ensure consistency, we use pre-commit hooks to automatically check for formatting, linting, and type checking before a change is committed. This reduces the risk of introducing code that does not meet style requirements and helps maintain a high-quality base of code.   

We require detailed documentation for all functions, classes, and modules, ensuring that the code is easily understandable by both developers and end-users alike. Documentation should be accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date to facilitate collaboration, and ensure code longevity and maintainability.      

We encourage contributors to use a consistent naming convention, and to avoid abbreviations and acronyms. Code should strive to be expressive and easy to understand, and avoid overly complicated or abstract logic that may hinder understanding across all contributors and users alike.  

## <font color = "red "> **Code must be PEP 8- compliant, using a pre- commit system that runs automatically before committing new content** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 9. Testing Guidelines

Thorough testing helps to guarantee the reliability, functionality, and stability of the Acme Project, enabling users to trust in our solutions and confidently integrate their software into the Acme Project ecosystem.   

To start, make sure existing tests are run before submitting a pull request. This can be done by executing the `pytest` (for Python) or `jest` (for JavaScript) commands, as defined in the relevant setup file, to ensure no regression is created.

We utilize a combination of unit, integration and regression tests across all areas of the project. Write new tests when submitting a PR, especially when new functionality is implemented or when a bug is fixed, to help prevent regression and increase stability.   

We expect tests to be well-written, readable, and comprehensive, to cover all the necessary functionality and edge- cases. All tests should be automated, meaning the tests must run without manual intervention, which facilitates continuous and reliable testing, and ensures quality across the entire project as a whole.      

We welcome the use of any testing frameworks, but it's best to adhere to the existing, widely recognized, frameworks, and tools, such as pytest, Jest, and similar frameworks to facilitate ease of contribution, and seamless maintenance.   

## <font color = "blue "> **All tests are automated, and well documented, following established frameworks** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 10. Documentation Contributions

To update or improve documentation, edit the relevant Markdown files ( `.md`) located under the `docs` folder within the repository, ensuring that all edits comply with the established style guide. The files will likely have some level of automated tooling running to ensure a degree of standardization is present, to promote accessibility and a unified feel to documentation across different parts of the system.  

Before committing, make sure you thoroughly test that your edits function seamlessly with all the necessary systems to avoid introducing bugs and errors. Please make the necessary changes so any errors can be corrected.  

To facilitate readability and comprehension for new members to a new team or contributor group, maintain consistency with our tone, writing, voice, vocabulary. The more we maintain these values the easier our documentation shall be accessible across different channels.  

We appreciate that you include sufficient explanation in your PR for your contribution for the rest of our contributor network and stakeholders alike. The easier our contributors can get the documentation up and running on any local or remote device or cloud server means we can scale better and maintain stability for longer and at reduced operating expenditure.   

## <font color = "blue "> **The document must be updated, reviewed, edited, before submission.** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 11. Commit Message Guidelines

Consistent and clear commit messages enhance collaboration, facilitate version control and help track progress in the software ecosystem of Acme project as a whole. Commit messages follow these general guidelines:

- Begin the message with a succinct subject (no more than 50 characters) to quickly and precisely define what has changed within this contribution. Follow that by one newline with a much larger body explaining more details if the subject can not cover enough scope, to provide sufficient background information that provides enough understanding as well to ensure ease and clarity within documentation.
- Subject Lines, if you follow conventional commits should utilize `feat:` , `fix:` , `docs:` , or another standard keyword at the top line as it describes the commit type (feat = Feature). 
- Keep subject line minimal, while providing context as necessary in larger, expanded bodies for further understanding.   

We also appreciate if any PR or documentation includes any screenshots that may provide visual cues for any potential stakeholders as part of understanding of any change to codebase from your work or contribution efforts. We appreciate this additional effort to help the overall quality to maintain.

Finally, commit with the assumption your commit will show in changelog for public users, thus commit as though all contributors are going to use the release for understanding future functionality for Acme ecosystem!      

## <font color = "blue "> **Consistent Commit, messages must contain the keyword and the type to provide more detail.**

<hr color="blue ">

## 12. Branching Model

We operate using Git Flow: 
* `main`: Production ready. No commits allowed. 
* `develop`: Development Integration point; All development should be based from develop. 
* `feature/*`: Development work on the feature.

Always use meaningful branch names such as  `feature/implement-auth`, for example to help maintain a degree of understanding when contributing to the ecosystem as well, providing clear understanding for other developers in understanding where contributions originated, as part of understanding where changes came to be.    
 
Always ensure that `develop` and the other team or contributor integration points always are maintained in a stable and reliable manner by utilizing the testing infrastructure we maintain to keep code running in optimal shape at every point! 

When feature complete merge `feature/*` branch into `develop`. When the development cycle reaches release-ready status (i.e `develop`), the team should release and branch a tag, which provides additional insight into which changes are incorporated at what state for release, ensuring all versions of releases stay synchronized in all aspects across documentation and development channels.     

## <font color = "blue "> **Branches, must use clear and consistent names with `develop` or production safe for team to merge.**

<hr color="blue ">

## 13. Review Process

Pull Requests go through a peer review by core developers before merging into the project repository to guarantee consistency. Reviewers look into code clarity, potential bug or errors that can impact existing code, test coverage for stability and consistency. They confirm all aspects, and provide feedback or ask clarifying questions to resolve ambiguity as needed and required for overall understanding and cohesion, for all members and team to ensure that they stay synchronized at any level across any contribution effort or development cycle!     

The goal is for a fast response, ideally in within 24 business hours for an inital code check for initial review as well feedback for clarity on the team. However this timeframe could shift dependent upon workload or the scope and nature of contribution, thus we would ask our teams that are participating, please allow flexibility as much is within your means in maintaining our ecosystem.      

Following acceptance and merge of changes a changelog entry may be updated and released if the merge necessitates this for release to public audience!        

## <font color = "blue "> **Changes should have clear and concise descriptions that ensure maintainability of team.**

<hr color="blue ">

## 14. Communication Channels

Our communication happens within Slack (acme-development), for discussions. Please create channels for the topic that aligns.
If your concerns can never get adequately address with these existing systems we can discuss further!     

If the issues persist please feel free to contact one of help@acme.net team to get additional clarification!      

If it concerns the legal and compliance, you can find additional support via lawteam@acme.net and we'd do everything possible in providing a secure experience as part of facilitating our community as best as we possibly can as an organization that respects our stakeholders' input to maintain integrity for our users across multiple dimensions, and for our long time community of dedicated team members.        

## <font color = "blue "> **Slack (acme-development) can serve communication and guidance for stakeholders.**

<hr color="blue ">

## 15. Security and Responsible Disclosure

Should you discover security vulnerbilities we would appreciate your help by not publishing to social and/or forums or publicly disclosing, until the proper fix has had sufficient testing applied and released to the public ecosystem!    

Please submit details privately by submitting it on securityhelp@acme.net so the necessary resources may address, assess vulnerabilities quickly and ensure our systems remain secured, safe and secure! 

Please allow up to a maximum period within the timeframe as possible (1 - 3 weeks), but it depends greatly upon resources for mitigation and scope as well severity to properly resolve!  
    

 
## <font color = "blue "> **All disclosures of security, or other potential breaches, must have secure, closed communication**

<hr color="blue ">

## 16. Release Process

Our software version and version updates and releases happen as necessary, based off feedback. When it hits version 1, the software can have a new, stable, and consistent experience to share for a wide user range of users to engage across platforms!    

The software gets tagged and deployed into production as per a release cadence schedule that is planned to ensure the stability of code. Any documentation will have a release cadence update with a versioning scheme in place that follows all best-industry guidelines that ensures a standardized version to be able to follow as we learn.   

Any new release is tracked on GitHub, which can assist the user with tracking releases in real time for updates or potential patches, for all the latest features for users, contributors and our dedicated team to benefit!      

## <font color = "blue "> **The version must be well tagged, well defined to facilitate release.**

<hr color="blue ">
## 17. Recognition

To show the importance, appreciation, we want to make certain everyone feels valued, acknowledged within contributions and as well recognized.  This is an evolving project and we value everyone.       

To that effort, everyone is publicly thanked within our public changelog file to give recognition within community.  As an alternative means to showcase our gratitude the Leaderboards may show all users listed as contributors as the project develops in real-time to demonstrate appreciation as it happens in live!      

We hope with our current means and methods that these methods provide recognition of your hard effort for building Acme into the future, together as part of one collaborative network. 
    

## <font color = "blue "> **Recognization of contribution can occur as changelog listings for visibility within the community.</font>

<hr color="blue ">

## 18. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

If this repository includes or requires contributions with intellectual property ownership from third parties that may affect its future distribution then, this CLA process needs formal legal approval and acknowledgement by a third part as the team is responsible, as the project moves from the current state towards maturity, from open to potentially commercial and requires additional efforts for legal alignment in maintaining its stability as an evolving system!

The purpose, of CLA, provides the team the necessary permission to utilize your submitted and approved intellectual assets.   Please take some time reading over it to ensure understanding before agreeing.    

The team appreciates the contribution, to Acme.  You are encouraged as always!      

## <font color = "blue "> **If there's IP rights from the team involved in building the code we may have the CLA agreement in effect!</font>
