# Contributors Guildeline

## ** 1.Introduction **

We warmly invite you  to contribute! Your participation, regardless of size, helps our community thrive and improves our shared project. Every contribution, from small fixes to new feature, helps us build and sustain a vibrant community for everyone.

Contributing isn 't limited to just code. Documentation updates, test coverage improvements, and thoughtful feature suggestions, as valuable, so we are happy to see contributions of those type and value them, too. 

We encourage a welcoming open source experience, where every voice is heard, and all contributions are valued!

 ## ** 2.Code-of-Conduct **

This project is committed  to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone who contributes. We expect all participants, whether you are a seasoned veteran, or a new starter, to be respectful, collaborative, open to diverse experiences, perspectives and skills and avoid disrespectful interactions, offensive comments, or any form of harassment.

Violation can be reported, and we take all reports of misbehavior seriosuly, we will work to resolve the issue and take necessary disciplinary measures including but, no restricted, to banning a person from the team or the community. 

We strongly encourage everyone to be mindful of their interactions, actively promote inclusivity, and contribute to the overall well- being of the community!

## ** 3.Getting Started **

To start collaborating, first, fork the repository from GitHub, creating your own personal copy.  Afterwards, clone the repository using the `git clone <your-fork URL>` command in your terminal or command line. Make sure to update any local packages before you start work using `npm install`.

Next you will need create a dedicated branch for your specific contributions by using `git checkout -b <your-branch- name>` where the `<your Branch> name> `is a description that explains your goal for this branch. This keeps your work organized and separate.

Finally, make your changes, test them thoroughly, and commit to your new branch before creating the pull request. This keeps your local repository tidy, and provides a good workflow.

 ## ** 4.How to Contriibute **

 There is a lot of ways to help with the project. You could submit a bug fix, suggest a new idea and feature, update our documentation to make it more readable, write automated or unit tests, and many more things!

Before implementing a significant feature, we strongly encourage opening an issue and briefly outlining your idea and discussing potential implementation approaches to prevent duplicate effort or misdirection. Open communication is very important to keep a healthy workflow within the team.

We encourage contributions of all types, whether big or small and we are excited to see what you come up with. Please, don't hesitate to ask and reach out if you need help!

## ** 5.Reporting Bugs **

To report a bug, create a new issue on the GitHub repository with a clear and concise title describing the issue. Be very precise.

Provide detailed steps to reproduce the bug, including any relevant environment information, versions of dependencies, configurations, and error log snippets.  The more information, the better.

A clear, reproducible bug report helps us understand, diagnose, and resolve issues promptly.

## ** 6 .Suggesting Enhancements **

 To propose a new feature or an improvement, create a new issue on this GitHub repository. In the issue, describe the idea with enough details, explaining the motivation behind it, and the potential use cases. 

 We appreciate clear explanations, including how the new feature would be used, what problems it aims to solve to improve the user experience, and what benefits it would bring to our users or the project in general.

Our maintainers will review your suggestions for feasibility, alignment with our project goals, and prioritize them alongside the existing backlog. 

## ** 7 .Pull Request Process **

To submit a pull request, first, create a descriptive branch name, typically prefixed with a `feature/` or `fix/`, reflecting the changes being made, example: `git checkout -b feature/my-new- feature`

Commit your changes following the Commit Message Guidelines in sections above (Section 11). Make sure each commit contains small logical units of work. Finally push it on to the GitHub, creating Pull Request to the branch.

 Our team will carefully review each Pull Request for quality, coding standards, adherence to existing design. After a thorough check it can be tested. If you address review feedbacks and test all passes, your pull request can get merged.

## ** 8.Coding Standards **

This project follows standard coding styles to improve the overall code.  This helps improve consistency throughout our entire team! This improves readablity for others in our project and future developers too. 

We utilize [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for Javascript files, and it's pre-configured to catch common stylistic issues and errors and automatically formats your code on saves in a modern code editor (or through CLI command `npx eslint . --fix`). Type checking should also be completed by using a tool, TypeScript to prevent errors early in the development workflow.

Adhering to our code of styles and lint rules ensure code is consistently tend and helps reduce code maintaince in the future!

## ** 9.Testing Guidelines **

Testing are very import and crucial. To ensure reliability of our software to function as designed by testing, please follow a series of rules outlined here. First of all, ensure the `npm test` command works in your working area with `node_modules` installed. This runs all tests currently in our repository.

If introducing new code that can break current system functionality, be sure to write automated integration or Unit test with `Mocha`, the tool our projects is setup to be tested using to test that the change is implemented well, doesn`t impact current working systems, nor bug- introduces more bugs than is solves. We want the highest possible testing- and test cases- covered code!

Ensure existing tests continue to pass before submitting.

 ## ** 10.Documentation Contributions **

Our Documentation, can use updates to better describe current inner work, apply improvements on clarity, ensure accurate descriptions on the current system and more!  We want this to remain up to date and helpful as time moves.

We store all our markdown formatted documentation file, within the `/docs/` directory located at the project roots. Feel free to push new updates there with Pull Request, as you see fit! Check your work, readability is key here, as our community is our users of the software that uses it as documentation, and that can have many skills and skillsets, so please take note and be careful!

## ** 11.Commit Message Guidelines **

Clear, descriptive commit message are key in any successful open-source projects to improve team understanding on why certain changes occur! 

We strongly encourages to use of "Conventional Commits", using prefixes `feat:` ,  `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:` to classify your contributions type! Use clear language and provide context within the description explaining your contribution, as this will help others review code. 

Well written-commit helps with debugging- understanding the changes to what they fix - or what is being introduced-

## ** 12.Branching Model **

The team is adopting, `Git Flow`, where a branching and releases is performed in order- from main/ development.

`Main/Development`, is considered to contain production code - never direct code there- use the branch for stable- working releases, only!. New work or features must come in new branch created on either,  main- branch and feature/ or a dedicated, long lived `Develop- Branch. This makes development, merging and testing of changes very manageable - especially in big, multi contributors projects like this.

## ** 13.Review Process **

All code, must first undergo thorough code reviews, by project Maintainers - where feedback is delivered in timely manner! Expect to receive detailed, and specific feedbacks, which might contain, coding standards improvements and style. 

 We value clear communications and are responsive in providing reviews to maintain high quality. We encourage contributors, and all members -to engage respectfully during a discussion. PR, after review will merge - or it get pushed back, until requirements meet.

## ** 14.Communication Channels **

If need, help - ask and join our slack at this Link:  [Example Link]. It is also an great space for casual communication or to share thoughts and ideas regarding any project aspect, with community members

 You can always raise your concern - or ask questions in Github repository Issues- for better management. The more you engage with team; it makes our environment healthier - where collaboration -and shared vision, becomes reality- and we achieve our goals more efficiently, with help and input from the members in our team!

## ** 15.Security and Responsible Disclosure **

Report Security Vulnerabilities: Please do *not* directly public the issue in Github!  

We takes all reported vulnerabilities extremely seriously, therefore - immediately send email with security concern, in a *private communication to security [Example Link]!

  Our team - will acknowledge, your responsible reporting. We will take timely corrective measures for security and keep our users secure as we value our members trust. We thank everyone that take care with responsible and secure coding standards in open code, too- 

## ** 16.Release Process **

A standard, repeatable version management strategy will keep a smooth, stable project. The new versions of projects will tag, with Sematic Verision Number, in git tags (v0.1.1 or like-this!)

  Changes in new Release are logged, as a change Log in /docs folder - which is updated to reflect- changes- in- each Version and `release`, which helps maintainers understand all changes!
   The team - follows best standard for release to make sure the release - are reliable- with minimal downtime or bugs and errors- that are possible to appear!

## ** 17.Recognition **

The community members get acknowledged by credits. In Change Log section in documentation - as the maintainer see fits and credits - the contributions of the people who worked with their hands. We want contributors recognized by all - community as the valuable asset in a project like this and a valuable asset of all of us- and a team to build and move-

 ## ** 18.Contributor License Agreement (CLA) ** 

Because the Project, has to maintain a certain protection - the contributors will have to acknowledge, a standard Contributor Licence - where you acknowledge rights that the license grant and assigns the code you work with back in open source, as well- for team to move - freely with code without worry/fear

 For this Project CLA- form will appear- if required for certain types of code/ contributions to the repository- You have access here:[Link CLA ] and you need sign, the License - for the rights.  

## ** 19.Resources and References ** 

Please take notes from our internal documents - to get familiar on standards - we work under, in-order and - to follow coding best practices- to create better, cleaner Code! We also - refer Google - and style Guides - that help us with readability - to keep standards - in Code as high - standard- in open - code and software.
