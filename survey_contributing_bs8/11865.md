# contributing to project-name # [Project URL (Replace)] 

Welcome! We are delighted that you're interested in contributing to [Project's Name]. Your insights and contributions help shape our project and make it a better product for others to use and enjoy - we truly appreciate your participation!

This guide details how you can contribute to the project, from suggesting enhancements to submitting code changes. Regardless of whether you are a seasoned professional or just starting on your programming path - your support can make a great difference!

Whether you report a tricky bug, improve our extensive documenation, help test our software, or provide feedback, we want your contribution! Your expertise helps us build high-quality software and a thriving community. 

## Code of Conduct

We want to cultivate a welcoming and inclusive environment. To do this, we ask that you respect each other, be mindful of diverse perspectives, and engage in constructive communication during the contribution process and in any discussion regarding this project.

All contributors, regardless of experience level or background, need to adhere to our Code of Conduct. This document outlines our expectations for respectful communication within our community as a standard for collaboration.

 Violations of conduct can result in the rejection of pull requests, temporary or permanent bans from collaborating on the project, or other appropriate corrective actions, as deemed necessary to maintain a productive and respectful environment.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need a compatible development environment (e g., a working version of Python and relevant dependencies). Please make sure you have Git installed, which you will use for fetching, branching and contributing code - the project is actively maintained using Git.

Before diving in to contribute, fork the repository on GitHub (or your preferred Git hosting platform). Once forked, clone your fork to your local machine using `git clone <your_fork_url>`.

After you clone the project, you' will need to create a new branch for your contributions - this helps ensure you don't break the `main` development path by directly committing. A good naming scheme is to use something like `feature/your-new-feature or fix/bug-number`. For this use: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature` .

Install any project dependencies listed in ` requirements.txt`. You can typically install dependencies using a command like `pip install -r requirements.txt` or equivalent for your chosen packaging system - make sure your Python installation works!

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute beyond submitting code! We gladly accept bug reports, feature suggestions, and assistance with documentation improvements. Even a small suggestion helps make our software more robust!

If you stumble upon a bug or notice a potential usability improvement, please don't hesitate to share it! Providing as much detail as you can, like what you were doing, the expected result, and actually what happened, are invaluable. 

We are more than open and willing to consider and implement your suggestions for new features or enhancements. Be sure to explain your motivation and potential use cases clearly. It would really make things better to understand where a proposed new change would be applied.

Submitting a Pull Request (PR) is the core process of contribution to project development! You should follow clear and structured commits - this way changes and the overall progress in code becomes clear! Make sure the PR's description details why the work needs to be changed.

## Reporting Bugs

To effectively report a bug, provide clear steps on how to reproduce the issue.  It is incredibly important for maintainers to be able reproduce bugs.

Create a minimal, reproducible example, demonstrating the problematic behavior in isolation, is highly desirable and greatly improves issue diagnosis - ideally the code is easy to execute with little setup work. You should report the specific operating system and browser information or relevant software.

Report all bugs by creating a new issue on GitHub using the issue tracker [Project URL (Replace)]. Make sure your bug report contains as much useful detail as possible so others are capable of addressing the root of the cause!

## Suggesting Enhancements

Proposing enhancements involves outlining the intended outcome of the new functionality or the rationale for any proposed improvement - why do we want or need it!  Provide clear examples of where these suggested additions might find value for potential use cases!

Please describe how the suggestion would be valuable. A strong explanation and context helps our maintainers evaluate and understand why implementing such feature would benefit all stakeholders involved in using it - consider describing it from both users, developers perspectives and so on. 

Feature suggestions will be evaluated for their complexity, relevance to the project goal, and overall value for end-users.  Prioritization happens during maintainer discussions based on these factors as new proposals accumulate, or conflicts between proposals occur!

## Pull Request Process

Before starting to write large-scale new additions or modifications to any functionality that's existing, you should communicate on any significant feature with maintainers and team. 

Always base your pull requests off the latest released state in the repository and never against local development builds of existing branches that do not represent a consistent snapshot! Use descriptive names, e.g. `git checkout -b feature/some-great-feature` - the branch needs to make logical sense.

Write clean, clear and easy-to-understand commit messages, that follow a conventional pattern - more is described on the Commit Messages Guideline (below) - that clearly convey your intent and modifications.

Pull Requests need be reviewed to ensure code style adheres to established coding style - if your code fails to follow those coding patterns then changes will occur until it passes! Once reviewed, the team decides if your Pull Request (PR) can be approved to become the current development state!

## Coding Standards

Follow our established coding standards, adhering to consistent style conventions for formatting, variable names, indentation. It is expected you are aware and can work towards the style guides for the languages that you are coding with!

Enforce coding styles and practices by leveraging automatic linters/code-style formatters. The tools we are employing are included to keep consistency within your own commits or the Pull Request (PR)! Make sure all your contributions can run and adhere!

Comprehensive unit and integration tests is expected of any changes submitted for the code! We have configured type-checking tools and other automated validation that you would be using in conjunction, as part of development workflows.

## Testing Guidelines

Our suite of automated tests helps to identify and resolve errors - run them and see whether the code works - this provides you the feedback needed before your code can get committed and approved by others - and is part of continuous improvement practices that help our projects succeed!

Tests must pass on local builds or the Pull Request may face rejections or additional review. You should have automated builds on continuous integrations services to help run your tests. 

If adding or modifying code in an area that does not currently have tests, consider writing comprehensive test cases that will validate both unit as well integration functionality.  This is critical as new additions and features can introduce regressions in otherwise working areas.

## Documentation Contributions

Help evolve our software! Improving or expanding upon it directly enhances it. If a feature's use isn't clear, consider documenting a use case - a great help towards making this easier!

You can contribute in two formats; by writing markdown, that will show within this guide, as this text does and/or through contributing documentation directly into code - for API docs that describe functionality of code, as example. The specific documentation folder and directory are [Doc's folder].

We need documentation and tutorials on all topics of usage to empower others and increase usage for everyone, especially when there are a variety of uses or applications - this helps the overall software ecosystem around it thrive and become more popular as new people can adopt our product more freely!

## Commit Message Guidelines

Adopting a well defined Commit Messaging system provides the means of making it simpler for all stakeholders, maintainers or contributors, in determining the scope, origin, changes or even purpose! It provides better clarity and traceability over time!

Follow conventional commits as much as you can. The pattern involves starting your commits by defining a short, one-to-six-character, descriptive tag. Such can use tags such as "feat:", for a feature implementation "fix:", and more! - a comprehensive table exists online detailing this.

Consistency improves overall collaboration efficiency - this enables easier automated versioning and documentation generation from your commits - a well formed log helps others determine which commit has caused any changes. Commit names need a concise, understandable explanation of your intentions or contributions for a commit!

## Branching Model

Our current branching strategy relies upon simple branches that target main! The general process would look like forking and then using the branching workflow for each change or modification made by developers - and this workflow ensures we avoid issues on main development path

We recommend using `feature/` to work with changes - or using the `bug/` prefix in your commit naming to help denote tone for any specific fix being done. This provides more information about where you might need the assistance!

The main/trunk/root should remain relatively pristine for stability.

## Review Process

Every submitted pull request gets assigned one or more Maintainers, who will be tasked at assessing it based on coding conventions. Maintainers provide clear suggestions as well comments, as well offer a clear explanation and feedback regarding areas of concern.

If a suggestion gets rejected by an assigned Maintainer, then we are committed towards working with our team on finding alternatives for it. It can happen that an issue presents unforeseen technical hurdles. We do want to work towards resolving it as soon as reasonably practical

All Pull Requests (PR) that get approval by reviewers pass to integration - then a final testing stage - if tests pass we integrate to master.

## Communication Channels

We value clear, and efficient communication to resolve problems quickly. To get support, reach out and connect! The most effective channels would include, Github's Issues (as previously described for any reporting bugs), for public-based questions/inquiries.

Consider also contacting our team at email address, if there were sensitive matters requiring direct support. This is to make certain all issues or requests have timely and dedicated help! Please note that project-internal chat platforms, if they existed and would apply to a team would exist somewhere - please ask if it applies or you can be provided a contact if relevant

## Security and Responsible Disclosure

Please contact our dedicated security channels, to alert and help our efforts. Please never publically disclose vulnerabilities as a default practice to protect the wider community of people using our code! Security disclosures help our project stay more secured!

If vulnerabilities get confirmed as being present then you get notified, per established protocol - this process enables quick mitigation and fixes!

## Release Process

When it has new stable builds and improvements ready - release builds occur at set periods. Release process typically requires automated checks and a few tests to determine if we should make this move or hold. The version numbering uses standard semver - meaning version increases happen when features change (major release increase for new API changes or new versions, minor increases with features that have minimal impact for current usage or a small API adjustment) and patch numbers represent fixes/bugs - these help provide context as changes progress through different releases

Tag releases to the repo - the tags allow the history of changes that go towards releases; Changelogs will be made to summarize important improvements, or features that occurred what was in releases as they become published. The deployments of changes get performed only once we've been verified and validated.

## Recognition

The most significant ways in acknowledging contribution, and rewarding contributors, are public recognition, as well listing their contributors in release and on-screen displays.

Contributor names and details will typically show at the start for release-documentation or in-game or web application display. A contributor-listing gets updated periodically as people submit PR, or as they make submission to help this community and project!  Our sincere gratitude for every person!

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

As our codebase is intended to support public-wide access, it has some legal requirements, especially in cases related to such access! A formal CLA outlines terms to ensure we are able to freely share with community its use. A signed form grants rights - that helps us to ensure that all parties understand how this work gets shared across. The current agreement to review is here: [CLA Form Link].  Signing is needed, but not present - we welcome feedback as well, for this process!

## Resources and References

Our style guides help ensure a level and uniform look - for documentation and coding practices and are hosted online and easily referenced! PEP8, is commonly referenced to guide coding in this context

Additional developer and technical documentation exists at [Dev Doc]. This documentation contains a lot of valuable and helpful info - we hope it's a help as the software is built - we welcome additional suggestions on improving!
