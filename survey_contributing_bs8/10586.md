# How We Contribute

Welcome! We're thrilled you expressed interest in contributing to our project. Contributions of any size, from bug reports to large features, are warmly welcome as they are vital fuel for our progress and growth of the project ecosystem.

Open source is driven by its people and their shared efforts. By joining us, you'll contribute to an evolving community dedicated to improving the project and making it the tool people rely on. We value the knowledge, experience and enthusiasm that new community members bring.

We believe in making this a welcoming and supportive environment. Your participation, regardless of your experience level, will significantly contribute to the project’s quality and longevity. So let’s get right into how to do so and contribute meaningfully.


 # Code of Conduct

 We expect everyone to treat collaborators, visitors and community in a kind and respectful manner and contribute to a supportive ecosystem. We value collaboration, and we strive to create an inviting space where all individuals feel safe and encouraged to share ideas and work together.

 Harassment, discrimination, or any behaviour that undermines a welcoming environment will not be tolerated and results in being asked to leave the collaboration as well as possible legal action as determined on a case by case basis. We are committed to maintaining a professional and constructive community environment.

 We encourage everyone to be empathetic and mindful of the impact that comments can have. Remember that online communications can be easily taken the wrong way, so it is essential to communicate with respect and understanding to foster a positive working atmosphere that allows all to contribute and grow. We all learn from each other as contributors as this community is built upon shared experience! 


# Getting Started 

Before contributing, you must set up our local development environment and clone the project. First, fork the repository on GitHub. Then, clone your fork locally using  `git clone <your_fork_URL>`. Navigate into the cloned directory using `cd <project_name >`.

Next, you should install necessary tools. For example, you might install `Node.js` with version at least `16.x` using a package manager of your choosing. Then you should install project dependencies via the appropriate means for the language. We use `npm install` to do so, which can be run within the project root folder after Node.js is installed.

To start development, you will need to configure an editor and a Git client for local changes. Make your changes to your local environment, committing frequently while developing. Ensure that each branch reflects a single goal, which helps with review and testing.

We use Git Flow branching model for our projects, which will be further explained later within this file. Create a new branch by checking out a new local branch using the command `git checkout -b <feature_name >` for each feature or fix you work on. 

Finally, before submitting, make sure all local changes are pushed to your forked repository. This enables a smoother contribution experience as you prepare for submitting a merge request.



# How to Contribute 

There are many ways to help improve the project, both through code and non-code contributions. You can submit bug reports, contribute to documentation, help with testing, suggest enhancements and even provide design feedback.

If you find a bug, please report it. If you notice areas where the documentation can improve, go ahead and update it with your knowledge. Every contribution helps the project grow. 

When implementing new changes, especially larger ones or complex refactorings please communicate your intentions by first creating an issue and discussing the implementation before you implement it to ensure that the work meets our expectations. This also avoids wasted effort if the proposed approach needs adjustments.

Before submitting a pull request with code, it is critical that you ensure your tests pass, and your code follows our established style conventions and coding standards. This ensures code compatibility and reduces review burden on contributors as we maintain consistency across all code submissions.



# Reporting Bugs

To help us resolve issues quickly, create detailed bug reports via GitHub Issues. Please ensure to search if there are already reports for the bug as duplicate bug submissions are less efficient for all contributors involved.

Your bug report must describe how to reproduce the bug and its expected behavior and the environment. Providing screenshots or a concise minimal reproduction scenario are also very helpful, making it significantly faster for the community to replicate your findings. The environment details can consist of operating systems used and any dependencies.

Clear bug reports are easier to diagnose, reproduce and debug efficiently, leading to timely solutions for issues impacting the broader project, and making our ecosystem stronger!



# Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to the existing one? Submit a suggestion via GitHub Issues describing the new function and why we should add this new element or modification.

Describe in detail the purpose of your suggestions including potential benefits of this enhancement on the overall usability and functionality. Include possible user stories outlining scenarios and how they'd impact project workflow as part of documenting.

Enhancement requests are prioritized according to their feasibility, community benefit, project priorities and maintenance workload involved with fixing and deploying such modifications into an official deployment cycle.  Your detailed proposals help guide our assessment and prioritization processes and help to refine them for future contributions.



# Pull Request Process

To contribute changes via a pull request (PR), ensure your feature or bug fix resides on a new branch that branches off from `main`. This ensures that the `main` remains unaffected with your code. Then use Git, push this new local branch onto GitHub and make your request from your remote to the origin.

Before a Pull Request can be merged the maintainers must verify your branch, ensure tests have run and pass. We will respond promptly to provide code review to improve your submissions as well, indicating the necessary updates for it to meet requirements before it becomes merged to the primary development. If your changes are deemed necessary the branch can then be incorporated as needed!

When creating pull requests make use of concise commit messages which can follow conventional standards to indicate a specific feature, a code-breaking error fixed or the updates that contribute directly towards the functionality you add, allowing us all to follow development and track the project changes over iterations.



# Coding Standards

Our codebase maintains certain style conventions for code consistency, making code easily navigable, maintainable and less complex across multiple contributor bases and project releases.

The preferred naming scheme uses CamelCase when declaring methods as public methods and snake_case as variables or attributes and constants as they produce better clarity, minimizing confusion for all contributors and future developers alike to ensure code comprehension when contributing in any means or forms of collaborative effort within our community base.  Use meaningful name declarations, avoid ambiguous declarations or unclear phrasing.

For automated code enforcement tools include a file `eslintrc.js` to maintain style checks on submission as they ensure consistency as we continue developing this platform across all releases of project iterations and releases of new functionalities as a collaborative group effort.  We will directly flag inconsistencies on submission so everyone maintains code clarity in every single code-submission process as contributors within our community effort.



# Testing Guidelines

Prior to any new pull request please test locally by utilizing all provided testing methods.  If you are creating or altering functionalities make certain your additions come bundled alongside automated tests. The primary goal being for code integrity to be upheld throughout any development iterations, which also serves a purpose as future proof to our releases as new changes occur or scale in complexity.

To add automated testing please leverage a standard library such as Mocha, and add test suites that mirror the functionalities and ensure all cases of functionality operate with integrity to meet requirements across a wide spectrum of edge conditions we anticipate as potential scenarios to ensure our platform scales to new needs without errors occurring at any time during the lifecycle as users begin adopting this system into any operational workflows they utilize within the broader environment it supports in its overall function.



# Documentation Contributions

Help make the project documentation more clear and comprehensive. The document lives alongside the `docs` directory where it's hosted within our system, allowing it to integrate well into project workflows with easy deployment of updated changes with automated build tooling and continuous iteration across contributor feedback loops for constant enhancements.

When making documentation additions, focus primarily on consistency across language used, grammar and overall readability and maintainable code-flow within the content presented as these all work in synergy when it comes to ensuring users have clear access when trying to adopt or utilize our software across their workflow implementations within our overall system ecosystem. Consider your contribution's purpose to enhance understanding!



# Commit Message Guidelines

Use concise and informative commit messages adhering to conventional commits standards as determined across all team efforts within each iteration and build release of this codebase across contributor base contributions from the overall system's developer community at all project release phases and build versions. The purpose in using conventions is standardization.

Conventional commit formats use descriptive prefixing highlighting purpose. Common standards like `feat:` denote features added. Other standard formats `fix:` denote error resolutions. And lastly documentation changes will include formats prefixed like `docs:`.  These conventions improve maintainability, code understanding as they enable efficient and clear navigation.

Well written commit message standards support code comprehension across team collaboration to streamline reviews to enable quick insight for anyone needing quick understanding. It also improves our changelog generation for version release tracking purposes to ensure we remain transparent to users as our ecosystem matures and improves as our codebase develops through continuous refinement.



# Branching Model

We use a Gitflow branching pattern for versioning, managing long-term development alongside maintenance releases with parallel releases with distinct release management approaches as the platform continues its ongoing maturation through each release build as it matures and becomes widely accepted amongst user community implementations into operational use workflows within various industries or applications that may leverage its features or services to facilitate business functions.

We will primarily utilize a branch called main which contains our production build that can be considered the most mature release. For ongoing changes that we will build upon outside our current production branch we will create separate branching to facilitate ongoing iterative refinements for future feature implementations. We strongly emphasize the utilization of a main release with minimal direct modification and focus all development changes to isolated feature development branch builds.



# Review Process

When a PR comes in for merge review by maintainers to assess changes, maintain quality of code.  The primary review objective includes verification of all test cases and automated standards being adhered too while assessing code comprehension across the overall submissions made in the contribution effort to improve overall codebase clarity while simultaneously ensuring all code standards being followed by contributor teams across project contributions and development cycles for efficient project scaling in terms of code base integrity and project growth.

If revisions and/or code-updates needed they may arise in this phase to further align and standardize with team-agreed code principles that help facilitate code maintainability across a distributed development and collaborative ecosystem for all involved stakeholders in the ongoing project contribution process, including but not limited to community, internal developers and end-users alike across broader adoption scope and scale.



# Communication Channels

You can reach out and discuss contributions with other project maintainers using various channels depending on what suits individual contributor preferences for communication to all contributors and maintainers of the ecosystem, facilitating collaboration and streamlining contribution efforts and feedback for iterative improvements within all codebases that exist.

Our dedicated discord group facilitates immediate collaboration with other team member contributions with instant response capabilities across real time communication, enabling quicker iteration, streamlining and rapid resolution to all contribution concerns as needed within any collaborative workflow and/or development iteration as required and needed by all project contributors involved and stakeholders within any contribution processes and project build and version management workflows, including all aspects and facets. 



# Security and Responsible Disclosure

Please be extremely wary about any security findings when it comes exposure within community forums to ensure we mitigate vulnerabilities and safeguard overall system and codebase health from exploitation and unauthorized system intrusion to maintain platform integrity in our project and its underlying ecosystem of all users who benefit as beneficiaries in all aspects as a collaborative system across broader implementations of its services across many various business or industrial functions within their operations that adopt this ecosystem as their foundational platform or toolsets utilized for operational implementations of any nature as applicable in this project across various user bases as part of ongoing operations processes that benefit across broader scope of implementation use-cases in the current ecosystem.

When encountering possible issues or bugs or defects please reach out and privately notify dedicated internal team security channel to avoid potential harm of public vulnerability exposures as we address defects promptly as a proactive preventative approach to maintaining overall integrity while working to rapidly fix vulnerabilities with the highest-priority in our planning roadmap across iterative development build planning to resolve and prevent such vulnerabilities or exploits that can be introduced by unintentional exposures within a publicly shared community platform and assurance as to security across the codebase, project ecosystem across broad scope and reach for ongoing users. 



# Release Process

Each official release occurs when changes that align closely within established criteria for stability or maturity reach certain standards to enable the platform being considered suitable as an officially sanctioned version that can undergo a release into general user-usage, and be made generally available across broader implementations as part of the ecosystem and broader operational functions and implementations in a user facing production release as a general service or application as a standard and accepted product to the user market as part of broader ecosystem consumption of the underlying platform, its capabilities, features and overall services and functionality.

New tags get generated for release versioning that aligns according the semantic-version standards and is then followed as documentation updates including release changelog notes for transparency with userbase for new versions being introduced and changes occurring, to enable seamless updates as required for adoption by any existing and potential stakeholders across userbases who rely on this application as it matures over continued releases and versions with evolving features that improve and refine the functionalities available. 



# Recognition

Your work as an integral and contributing factor in improving this software, which has resulted directly with improvements and new feature additions as the ecosystem of the application grows and becomes adopted more broadly in its userbase, will receive proper acknowledgment in various places throughout public documentation as contributor credit for your specific involvement. The contributor listings as part of release builds will also provide proper credit and visibility as recognition in this ecosystem that is growing as efforts of a broader group as contributors working in alignment and cohesion towards a single purpose to create an effective product and service for its community that will serve all parties involved.

Additionally changelog updates across build version releases as well highlight significant or major contributions and/or features introduced across builds with corresponding recognition and appreciation towards contributor team effort as a means of ensuring ongoing support towards community efforts as an acknowledgement towards contributions made that drive growth. 



# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

We may implement CLAs that grant us explicit licensing for contribution, as part of standard practices within open-source project frameworks that require a formal and agreed framework as an underlying requirement and legal basis for ensuring our team and the larger user ecosystem benefit appropriately, with all legal permissions being properly addressed, as this allows for our ability to ensure legal and copyright ownership is handled responsibly within open sourced frameworks to enable continued community development.
