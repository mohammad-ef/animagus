# Contributors Guildeline

## ** 1.Introduction **

We warmly invite you  to contribute! Your participation, regardless of size, helps our community thrive and improves our shared project. Every contribution, from small fixes to new feature, helps us build and sustain a vibrant community for everyone.

Contributing isn 't limited to just code. Documentation updates, test coverage improvements, and thoughtful feature suggestions, as valuable, so we are happy to see contributions of those type and value them, and we appreciate the community involvement. This document outlines the steps involved. Let’s work together to create a fantastic resource!

## ** 2.Code of Conduct**

Our community values respectful interactions among all involved participants. Treat fellow contributors with kindness and empathy, and foster a welcoming collaborative work. Construct feedback, even if it is tough to hear, should be delivered respectfully and thoughtfully, as we value each opinion, and encourage a safe, collaborative work area.

Har harassment, discrimination, or any behaviour that could create a negative atmosphere is absolutely intolerable. Our goal is to maintain a safe working environment, and anyone not following guidelines will have actions taken on their involvement. A safe, welcoming and productive workspace is our collective duty, and it benefits the entire community.. 

We are all in this journey to make the best product together, so we ask that you join and respect all community guidelines as stated above. 

## ** 3 . Getting Started**
  
To start contributing effectively, you will need the project installed on your personal machine. First fork the project from the main repository, then clone the fork down to your local development workspace.. Ensure your local environment meets the project's system requirements which are listed in the project ' README '.

We recommend you create a feature or fix branch, so you can maintain your personal changes without impacting main. Use a naming convention such as ` feature/new-awesome-component ` or ` fix/typo-in-documentation`. This ensures a clean work environment, as we are using branching to maintain project stability and ease of collaboration. 

To start building and test the project, follow the steps outlined in the README: ` yarn install` or ` npm install` to grab dependencies , followed by `yarn build`. This ensures a clean and easy starting experience, so contributors are set up quickly! We encourage a thorough setup to minimize build and testing challenges down the line

## ** 4. How to Contribute**

The best way to make a difference is to get involve! You can help by reporting bugs when you find problems, by suggesting features and enhancements that would improve the project, and, most of all, by submitting your code and documentation changes via carefully crafted pull requests.

Improving our documentation is a vital contribution. Clear, concise and up-to -date documentation makes the project accessible to new users and reduces the number of common support requests. This helps the community, by providing clear documentation, as we can all work with the project better with proper information and knowledge.
   
Before undertaking substantial work, please discuss it with the core project maintainers. This avoids wasted time spent on work that isn’t in sync. We are a team!

We welcome any contribution, big or small, and value anyone that can contribute. The project relies on community contributions for it to thrive in the industry. Please get started, and feel free to reach out with any assistance

##  **5. Reporting Bugs**

When encountering a bug or an unexpected behavior, it ' s important to report it with all the relevant details. Start by describing the issue, outlining which steps lead to it, what output or behavior was exhibited, and what you expected.

The most useful bug reports include a **reproducible example**. This can be a code snippet, a test case, or a sequence of steps, so the maintainers can quickly recreate the issue, and debug it quicker, which benefits the entire community. 

To report a bug or a potential issue, please create a new issue on the [GitHub Issues page](link to your GitHub issues page). This will keep the discussions organized, and easily accessible. 

## **6 . Suggesting Enhancements**

Have a new idea, feature, or improvement for the project? We would love it! Start by creating a new issue on the [GitHub Issues page](link to GitHub issues page) with a detailed description of your suggestion. 

Clearly articulate the motivation and potential use cases for your suggestion. This allows the maintainers to see the value it adds. Providing any mockups or diagrams of functionality, can provide context to your enhancement as well, for ease and clarity

We have several maintainers which oversee project changes, who thoroughly reviews these ideas to ensure that new feature additions align with project's roadmap, architectural principles, and goals. 

## **7. Pull Request Process**

Before you start work on something, it may be a great practice to discuss and share an overview to maintainers for constructive feedbakc! 

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Create a new branch**:  ` git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature ` 
3.  Write your code following our standards (explained below).
4.  **Commit** your changes with clear, descriptive messages. (more details to come.)
5.  **Push** your changes to your fork. 
6.  **Open a Pull Request** (PR) from your fork to the original repository. Make sure to reference relevant issue IDs (e.g., Closes #123).

All pull requests are meticulously reviewed for style, design, functionality, and test coverage, as well.  After review is finished, if approved and all conditions fulfilled, it merges with main, adding functionality

## **8. Coding Standards**

Consistent coding standards help keep our project code understandable, consistent, and easy to read, which in turns makes debugging simpler. Adherence ensures that our codebase will stand the test of time, even as developers transition. 

This include following indentation of ` 4 spaces`, clear code and comment styles to ensure that the functionality remains easily digestible.  It includes the naming, such as `camelCase ` in the JavaScript, and other standardized approaches throughout different languages we implement in the projects. 

Our linter `ESLint` configured in `.eslintrc.js ` is integrated and enforced in development builds as our style guidelines are in there as well!

## **9. Testing Guidelines**

Tests ensure quality code and prevent bugs. Write new unit tests and test coverage with your contribution for each change you add or edit!  The tests should verify functionality in both the happy path and in potential failure situations

Use our supported testing frameworks like Jest, and run them locally ` yarn test ` after implementing changes, and also when doing reviews as well, so all is good, for a smooth deployment,

Regression tests help maintain backward compatibility when adding functionality as our codebase changes to maintain a good project experience as users upgrade or change the code. It's encouraged, as they provide additional stability.

## **10. Documentation Contributions**

Clear documentation allows new users to get familiar quickly, to reduce the "entry hurdle" of joining. This documentation can consist of readme documentation to tutorials to code level documentation

Our main documentation are in Markdown in `/docs`.  Feel free to modify these files as long as you make it easy to navigate. Consistency, correctness, and readability must be prioritized.  If the content changes drastically or a separate guide/section has to be created, please communicate to team first

## **11. Commit Message Guidelines**

Commit messages provide context of changes for others working on this product. We encourage Conventional Commits for our product! 

The messages have format of: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`. `Type` is usually `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation change), or `chore` (project maintenance), among other types! We can see this convention on many open source communities, such as Vue JS 

Clear, concise descriptions provides a brief description. For longer descriptions please include it with additional text!  A properly constructed commit log, makes the team easier work together, as we all understand our project!

## **12. Branching Model**

Our repository uses a [Git Flow](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/git-flow/) inspired branching model.  Main and `develop` branch should always be kept stable by merge in PRs

*   `main`: Stable release branch, which only includes tag for a new release of code, as our release strategy
*   `develop`: Integrated development branch
*   Feature branches start off develop

For feature changes always checkout off `develop`:  ` git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature ` , and instead when addressing hotfix, do so with the ` fix/bug-title`.  It provides a structure which helps with managing the different changes!

## **13. Review Process**

Once you have open up your PR with a detailed explanation to our maintainers! A team will meticulously examine changes, with comments for any necessary adjustments needed to fit standards and quality goals

We will request changes or improvements to your proposal to address code style inconsistencies and/or logic gaps! Be prompt when addressing changes as they are being made and always keep open communications as a community is stronger! We encourage open discussions!

If it gets all checked, merged! You are part of it

## **14. Communication Channels**

The main method of discussing project related changes and decisions, would be using Github. Feel free to create issues, tag a contributor.

Join the our community discord `discord.link`. Feel free to join in! Participate actively on our forums as that encourages better team building, for an improved product! We are always ready to chat

## **15. Security and Responsible Disclosure**

Should you find any suspicious vulnerabilities that require fixing please contact maintainers `security@email`.

Refrain disclosing any potential issues that need fixes.  Do *not* publicly report a discovered flaw or vulnerability! We value privacy above all. We appreciate a responsible and prompt fix of a product and value the team work from the beginning to ensure top of security. 

## **16. Release Process**

After PRs have merged on our ` develop `  the maintainers prepare for releasing to our production server, which will involve testing for any regression bugs and making last second edits for documentation as we prepare it!  Tag the new releases to versioning.

After this a `CHANGELOG ` update to be prepared and a new ` main ` tag will created and then a push will made into a remote. After the process our product goes to our customers

## **17. Recognition**

Your hardwork doesn ' t go unseen, our contributors are publicly credited and listed in ` contributors.md`. A ` CHANGELOG ` record is provided and will openly recognize each and every one of our team

If a project needs documentation we give a badge as acknowledgement as community contribution

## **18. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**

If we ever move to require this please follow our CLA guidelines as that is the current state, as a defensive strategy

A contribution to a product will be under a CLA to protect legal permissions granted

## **19. Resources and References**

Please reference this documentation to keep our coding styles clean!
We love using ESLint `https://eslint.org`. Feel free to review it as part of code quality. Google Javascript coding standards as they're pretty solid: https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html
