# CONTRIBUTING TO MyCool Project

## Introduction

We welcome all contributors to MyCool Project! Your support, whether technical or not (ideas and documentation are incredibly important!), significantly enhances our shared goal of a robust and accessible tool. A thriving and open project relies completely on contributions from a passionate community and we are happy to see your help. This guide provides a structured overview of contributing processes, ensuring a streamlined, pleasant, and productive contribution experience.

Contributing means you help us build an open-source project, improving the software, documentation, or other aspects. This is a collaborative effort and a valuable skill to hone for any developer! 

We encourage both new & seasoned programmers! Every piece of help, be it a bug fix in the core, a simple documentation update and a detailed test, is a step towards better software. Join, learn, contribute and grow with our team. Thank your for thinking to collaborate and help build an awesome thing! We're so happy that you have come to this file. Please have a wonderful and helpful coding!

## Code and Conduct

We expect everyone contributing to My Cool Projects, directly (commits, pull requests etc.) or passively (reporting a concern), to act with a commitment to kindness! The project is meant to foster a collaborative & respectful environment for developers from all backgrounds, skillsets. Be mindful of communication, especially when providing critique or suggestions to avoid any form of disrespect, harassment, or any sort of negativity towards another developer on the same team.

This commitment extends to respectful language, constructive feedback, and an eagerness to listen to differing viewpoints. Any behavior that disrupts a respectful environment, including harassment or discrimination, is not welcomed, and will lead to exclusion.  

To guarantee an environment built on collaboration and inclusivity we have a strict policy that will remove individuals who violate. Repeated infractions, a single serious infraction, or a disregard for others will be considered a failure to abide by these guidelines. The core team has the final decision on any violation concerns. The goal is to maintain a positive, encouraging, and supportive community that encourages participation and creativity from individuals with diverse skillsets, ideas.

## Getting Started

Before making contributions you must have the tools installed, and the required environment setup. The simplest way to start is to download the codebase from the GitHub repository using:
 `git clone <repo_url>`.  Afterward, you should `cd` into the project directory that was just extracted.

To run MyCool Projects, you'll need the right versions of the tools. We highly recommend installing these using a tool to manage the versions. We support the versions mentioned in a separate `dependencies.md` file. Please check there for specific versions.

Now that the codebase is cloned, create a new branch named for the task you' are about to complete:  `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`. This keeps your changes isolated from the `main` branch to ensure the integrity of the core functionality. 

Finally, install the necessary dependencies:  `npm install` (example - change if different), and then run tests with `npm run test` (again, change as necessary) for a sanity check of the current environment.

## How to Contribute 

We are happy you wish the collaborate! MyCool offers opportunities of contribution across a broad spectrum of tasks that are not only restricted to software. The goal is to build an open platform that is easily accessible for a large and diversified population. The first step is often the reporting of a bug! This allows us to track down the root problems. 

We encourage users or developers to report potential features or new improvements, or even small suggestions, to improve the overall platform experience. These ideas are reviewed regularly. 

Submitting a new pull request, with your work, is the main way to contribute changes.  We will review these requests before accepting them. We also welcome improvements to the documentation to assist future users. Please read through and understand the existing documentation before editing and adding to the information.

We highly suggest you reach out to a team member and start a discussion before starting any large changes. We can discuss potential issues before you commit a lot of work, which prevents you potentially doing unneeded work, or even work that does not match what the maintain team wants to go after. 

## Reporting Bugs

When you encounter unexpected behaviour in our system, or discover an error, it is important to provide detailed reporting for debugging purposes. Before you submit a new bug, search to check if the issue is already being tracked, and that the report hasnt already been made and is under discussion with other team members.

A well-reported bug typically includes a concise title, a descriptive explanation, your environment setup, steps to reproduce the behaviour (critical for us!), and any relevant screenshots or error messages.  A reproducible demonstration helps us to understand, reproduce, and fix the problem quickly. 

We track all bugs via GitHub Issues (link to your repository' issues). Be detailed in creating a new issue by using the "Bug report." We encourage contributors to provide as much detail as can, but keep them to the point. We are all working hard to resolve the problems that are brought to us. We appreciate the help.  

## Suggesting Enhancements

Have a fantastic idea for a new functionality, usability improvements? Great, we value your suggestions! Please share them in a detailed and organized approach, so the team members are better understand what the goal you wish to accomplish. The goal is to build an open platform that is easily accessible for a larger user base, while keeping a clean and simple user experience.

When you share a suggestion, please explain your motivation clearly. Describe what problem this feature will solve or what value it' will bring, in addition a list of the potential use cases, to help us better understand its purpose. A detailed description, including mockups or diagrams, can significantly improve the clarity of your proposal.

We prioritize enhancement suggestions based on impact, feasibility with our overall goals, alignment with project goals, and the potential return-on-investment of resources to implement. We may ask for clarification of requirements, additional information or even a collaboration on the implementation of your suggestion

 

## Pull Request Process

To propose your contribution you must first create a branch named following our conventions. This will help the team better understand what type of change you are proposing (bug, feature, etc.) We expect you to follow a standard commit structure, as we will describe later in this file.

Once you've made your change and committed it, you can push it to the remote branch and subsequently open a pull request, to submit to the main repo `git push origin feature/your-branch-name`. We will then review it, asking for feedback and making suggestions, before it is integrated into `main`.

After a successful review and passing tests, you' ll be asked to create a merge request. After it has been confirmed, we' ll automatically merge. The PR is automatically merged if the tests all pass, the code meets our standards, and maintainers approve it. Please read through the Code Standards and Testing Guidelines sections. This helps the maintain team quickly integrate. 

## Coding Standards

MyCool projects aims to maintain a consistent and maintainable code base by adhering to strict coding style conventions. Please read through the existing style conventions, and try to stick to what the team is using. Consistency is critical here.

We enforce a style guide to promote consistency, which can be achieved through automated tools. These guidelines cover indentation, naming, comments, documentation, and formatting, so that any member of the team, can easily understand what the existing codebase is doing. Please read the specific coding conventions, for a complete and detailed look into what is expected.

## Coding Style Tools

Our code style is automatically checked via the `prettier` (example tool - replace as needed) and ` eslint`, (example tool) integrated in ` npm` (example tool) and are enforced during CI. The ` .eslintrc.js` and ` .prettierrc.js ` files store specific configuration details about these tools and should not be tampered with, unless given specific approval from a core contributor team. 

## Testing Guidelines

A robust suite of tests forms an important component of our code. Before committing, we ask that every contribution must pass all existing unit, integration, and regression tests, as well as new added tests for the functionality implemented within the change. This is a very high priority for ensuring quality within the project.

We utilize testing frameworks like [Testing Framework Name - e.g. Jest, Mocha (replace with what you' use)] (link to documentation) for writing tests that run automatically. We encourage a "test-driven development (TDD)" approach, where you implement the tests prior to implementation to help focus on what's needed. 

## Documentation Contributions 

We encourage and welcome contributors that wish to contribute to the project documentation, to help new users better learn the system or understand a more complex feature. The documentation is a valuable resource! Please check for errors or omissions, which can easily be overlooked during development and implementation.

The documentation files are located in the `docs` folder, and written using [Documentation Language - e.g Markdown - or reStructuredText]. Please adhere to the existing format and style, and ensure the language and writing is concise, easily digestible, and accurate and consistent with our coding and design standards. 

 

## Commit Message Guidelines

To facilitate easier and more effective code collaboration, we require that all commit message adhere to a consistent structure and format, so maintain team members know what type of change is being proposed and quickly understand what is included in the code.

We expect each commit to have a short, descriptive title, followed by a detailed explanation, in the body of the commit message. We strongly recommend following the conventional commit style, using prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc to clarify the type of change.

## Branching Model

The team utilizes git flow, a common branching strategy, to manage development, maintenance and release branches. The `main ` (previously `master`) branch holds production ready release branches, and `develop` (previous `development`) is a integration branch to integrate and test changes.

To work on a new functionality, or a bug fix, create a feature branch based on ` main` and name it like `feature / <your-feature>` or `fix / <your-issue >`, so other members of the code team can easily understand the nature of the changes. Never commit directly to the `main ` or develop branches and only merge when you are ready to propose a pull request.

## Review Process

All pull requests are carefully reviewed by one or more maintainers of the My Cool Projects team, to ensure code quality, adherence to coding style guide, and proper functionality. Please ensure you follow the existing standards before submitting a PR.

Reviewers will provide feedback and suggestions, so be prepared to iterate on your code until it meets project criteria. Please be responsive to feedback, and be willing to collaborate to reach a mutually agreeable solution. 

## Communication Channels

For questions, support, or collaborative discussions, we provide a number of different channels for communication. The most active and primary channel, is the GitHub discussion section on the project repository (link to the repository's discussions).  

We also have a community Slack chat, for real time support and conversations (link to the Slack chat). Additionally, we use GitHub Issues, for bug reports, feature requests and general project management

## Security and Responsible Disclosure

If you believe you've discovered a potential security vulnerability, we strongly request that you do not disclose it publicly. Instead, please privately report any concerns or issues by contacting us (security@yourproj.com) (replace with an actual email) or by creating a confidential issue on our GitHub issue tracker, and mark it as "security".

We are committed to responding to all security reports in a timely manner. Our response time will depend on the severity and scope of the reported security vulnerability, which is prioritized by the team's security specialists.  

## Release Process

Releases occur as and when needed by either major (adding features) or minor improvements or maintenance updates, with versioning in line with `Semantic Versioning`. Releases can occur when bugs have been solved or significant enhancements that can be used on the system is ready.  

Before any new releases can happen, maintainers review the current state of code. Tag a release branch to signify this and bump version, which follows semanticing version, to signal to our user's of changes that has been released to ensure stability within their applications

## Recognition

We recognize the vital work done from community, and contributors are always credited in project. Our team lists contributor, which lists contributors that are actively engaged with helping out with project, so that their effort's may not go unrecognize and their hardwork and dedication.

Additionally we provide changelog and version credit that will highlight those contributors in each of those sections, which gives additional acknowledgement within each major update of the product!

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

If MyCool Project requires external code or assets under license (e.g., if it incorporates parts of another open source project that require an individual CLA) then it might include the process in the future to protect its intellectual property from contributors! This agreement helps the legal teams prevent legal problems in the future that are often overlooked by new team members or external members contributing code!  

If required at a future date the specific CLA form that the individual will need to go to, can be linked in the main website: ( link for example ).  If there is a problem or a legal matter we'll always notify and ask our collaborators.
