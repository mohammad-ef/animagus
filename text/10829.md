# Task Management Engine - "Tempo"

**Tempo** is a task and productivity tool built for managing and prioritizing tasks, facilitating team communication and enhancing workflow.  It aims to address the challenges of modern workplaces by enabling efficient task organization with detailed tracking. This system is suitable to use as a replacement for existing solutions, but is also modular and can be integrated into other software platforms to add functionality or extend its usage.

This system focuses on a modular and extensible microservice design using Python and Docker which simplifies the deployment of tasks on multiple operating platforms and cloud environments, ensuring portability of services. Its key functionality encompasses creation and prioritization and assignment of tasks and their dependencies, and progress reporting. The project is built as a backend API, allowing integration with frontend interfaces or other applications. It' is ideal for agile team work.

We are striving to build an application that is scalable and adaptable to different user and team workflows. Our system allows the users to set custom deadlines and reminders. Tempo is built with a focus on providing robust data persistence and ensuring a seamless and consistent end-user experience. We hope you will consider using and improving our software!  

Ultimately, Tempo is a productivity solution that aims to simplify workflows and increase overall team collaboration while being flexible to accommodate different use cases and team structures. The modular system design will ensure that it can be customized to meet your organization' s particular workflows, increasing flexibility and productivity while reducing the cost and complexity of tasks and their assignments.. The project is actively maintained and will be updated with new improvements.

This is a Python driven application with asynchronous messaging, ensuring maximum throughput for all requests and tasks. Tempo can be configured via environmental variables for deployment, making it easy to integrate into cloud deployments. This allows us to focus development on the user facing API, rather than worrying about infrastructure.

## Installation Instructions

Prerequisites to installing Tempo are Docker and a modern terminal environment (e .g. Bash, Zsh) that can run Docker commands.  A basic level of command- line comfort, including navigating directories.  It is highly suggested to use either MacOS or Linux as this project does not currently have a full testing and development suite for Windows operating system..

You must have Docker installed and running before proceeding, which enables us to run Tempo and its dependencies in container format which simplifies the deployment of tasks on multiple operating platforms and cloud environments, ensuring portability of services.. You can verify your Docker installation by running ` docker info`.  A message should appear with your Docker system information.

Clone the Tempo repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone <repository_url> 
cd Tempo
```
This retrieves all source code and related files needed for installation.  You need to replace `< repository_ url>` with the appropriate location for your Tempo software source.

Install Python dependencies within our development containers:

```bash
docker image build -t tempo-app .
```
 This command instructs Docker to build a Docker container with our app. This process downloads, compiles, and links the software dependencies needed by Tempo. 

After successful image build, launch the app:

```bash  
python -m tempo.app # Or any other entrypoint script
```

Ensure you have the `python` executable in your environment path. You may also need to specify the location for Tempo to access the environment if there is interference with any other software on the operating system.

If you encounter dependency issues, make sure the correct versions are installed and check for conflicting packages. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies if needed and resolve potential conflicts during the process.. It is possible to run this software using a Python container, but you will need some understanding of Docker for doing so. 

For Windows users, consider using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). This provides a Linux environment within your Windows OS for seamless development and deployment using Docker and other standard utilities..  Docker Desktop for Window should work, but may need some tweaking.  

The Tempo repository should now be ready for configuration and use.. You might want to run a few basic test commands before using production tasks for verification. The project is actively maintained and will be updated with new fixes and enhancements.  

## Usage Instructions

To launch the Tempo API, you can run:
```bash  
python -m tempo.app
```
or

```bash   
./run.sh # Example entrypoint
 ```

This initiates the main Tempo server, listening on port `8000`. You should verify this port is not used and is accessible. To access the Tempo API endpoints, you can use any REST client of your choice. Postman and curl are some popular alternatives.

To create a new task, send a POST to `/ tasks` with a payload in JSON format containing fields for `description (mandatory), due_date ( optional), and assigned_to (optional).` A success should return a 201 code and a newly assigned ID for future reference .

To retrieve all open tasks you can issue a GET request to `/ task`. A success should return a 200 with a JSON array. To query tasks based on a specific assignee, you can send a GET query on `/tasks?assign = {username}`

You can update a task's information with `PUT /tasks/{task_id}`. The response code should return 200 on success or 404 if the id could not be identified within the repository..  Use a JSON payload for any parameters that you are changing.

The API supports filtering by `status` ( open, in_progress, completed) and ` due date`. Example : `/task?status= open& due_date=&lt;date format&gt;` will return a list of all open task with the requested due- date. You can test this by creating a new task. 

For bulk operations ( e.g., updating all open tasks ), Tempo supports asynchronous job queue, which can be configured and enabled through environment variables..  The asynchronous job queue should be monitored for errors or stalled tasks and addressed promptly. 

To test the Tempo API you might want to write a series of automated integration tests with a Python framework and libraries such as ` pytest and requests`.  These tests should cover basic API operations to ensure the stability and correctness of the system.. This would allow users to test for any unexpected behavior before using production workflows.    

## Configuration

Tempo relies on configuration to control its behavior and connection to other system components.  All configuration parameters are available as environment variables for easy management in deployment environments.  These parameters allow you to adjust the Tempo server's functionality, database connection, logging level, etc .

The primary environment variable is  `DATABASE_URL` which should define the location for persistent data. By Default, Tempo utilizes SQLite which allows for a lightweight database, but it is encouraged to deploy with a dedicated PostgreSQL or MySQL instance for larger teams or applications.. The connection URL will vary according to your database type.

Another crucial environment variable is  `PORT` that defines how Tempo exposes it's API. A default port has been pre-configured to 8000. If you intend to deploy Tempo within a reverse-proxy or load balancer then you should configure this variable accordingly..

Logging is configured through the `LOG_LEVEL` variable, which can be set to `DEBUG ` for detailed information, `INFO` for general activity and `WARNING` or `ERROR ` for error messages, or `CRITICAL` for severe system errors.. The `LOG FILE` variable defines the path where log data is to be stored.

Additional parameters, such a number of worker thread for the asynchronous job queue, and API security keys, are available for advanced customization and security hardening..  These can be specified and configured on a per instance basis for greater security and efficiency..  Consult the documentation for a complete list of supported environment variables.  

The application will fall back to default settings if any of your configurations are not present.. However, it is highly recommended that you explicitly configure all environment variables to ensure consistent and predictable behavior across different deployment environments. Configuration parameters can be dynamically updated without requiring a redeployment, allowing for quick adjustments to Tempo without any interruptions .

You should regularly review your configuration settings to maintain optimal performance and security as you scale your Tempo application.. Consider automating configuration deployments as you grow your system, to streamline deployments. The Tempo team provides a full documentation of all configurable items.

## System Architecture

Tempo operates with a microservice-based architecture. We have separated services to enhance modularity and maintainability of all of the Tempo functions.. At the heart of Tempo lies a REST API layer written using Flask. This handles requests, interacts with other microservices, and generates a standardized response for external clients .

The application layer interacts with the Data layer using `SQLAlchemy` , a robust object-relational mapper and persistence manager . Data models for tasks and user data are handled via `SQLAlchemy`. The API server is stateless for scaling reasons .  This makes the server very easy to configure.

To increase performance of task scheduling Tempo is implemented asynchronously and is built utilizing Redis for queuing jobs, with the use of worker thread, improving system utilization.. These background threads handle complex or computationally heavy actions that might cause latency or degrade overall user experiences on requests and data operations. This allows tasks to process asynchronously.

Communication between various internal system processes can also include gRPC or similar mechanisms, although currently Tempo utilizes messaging for task handling to simplify development,. We are open to adding this as part of feature requests in our project's development and implementation. Data is persisted into either local files and / or an online SQL Database for persistence and redundancy across various deployments. 

## API Reference

The Tempo API allows programmatic interactions. Here's a basic outline, with examples, of its functionalities and endpoints :

*   **`/tasks` (POST):** Create a new task. Expect JSON payload in form:  `{"description": "Clean Room", "due_date": "2024-12-31", "assigned_to": "admin"}`
*   **`/tasks` (GET):** Retrieve all tasks.
*   **`/tasks/{task_id}` (GET):** Retrieve a specific task based on an id . For instance `task = get ( "https://api.Tempo .io/task/533582" ) ` . Expect 200 response or an ID Error..
*   **`/tasks/{task_id}` (PUT):** Update an existing task.. For Instance,  Update Task's assigned user using this code. : ```  PUT https:// Tempo/task/99 { "assigne": "JohnDoe}   ```

Response formats for requests include both standard json and text files, with varying degrees of detail depending on request submissions .

Additional features and API methods such as bulk tasks operations , filtering based on criteria and data management functions are under construction . Check back in later releases..  Documentation for more detailed specifications and parameters, including headers will soon follow. 

## Testing

The `tests/` directory houses both unit and integration tests that cover key parts of the application code. Tests can be initiated in any directory within `Tempo`, assuming your operating environment and software is appropriately installed to do so.   Tests can be invoked with a command of : 

```bash 
python -m pytest # Or any relevant test launcher .
```

Test configuration parameters, secrets and various environment dependencies will all be contained inside of your containerized test directory, to keep them contained, isolated and to keep the integrity. This allows tests to pass with greater certainty, and will also assist developers and users in the debugging. .   Test results will output in console for debugging if issues occur, or a more elaborate output for the build pipelines for deployment to other services and servers.

We follow a "Test Driven Development"(TDD) workflow and encourage all contributions and updates include tests for code changes..   All tests are executed during our build automation process, preventing vulnerabilities to our customers as they integrate this application with others.   This practice also ensures the reliability and integrity. 

## Troubleshooting

Here are common considerations during initial Tempo installations, along with potential solutions for debugging issues during runtime and configuration . 

**Issue**: Connection Errors. 
Solution: Check `DATABASE_URL ` for any formatting errors.. Also verify you server database instance has started correctly and accessible. . Also make sure firewalls or cloud restrictions permit connection on the specified port, as it is a frequent occurrence in production and testing environments. 

**Issue**: Slow API Requests..
Solution:  Monitor server utilization to look into potential hardware bottleneck. Check that your `Redis cache` configuration works well. Also make sure that the data queries don `t result in an unexpected amount of resources or latency in data access,.   Review and analyze performance data with monitoring to find a root cause..   Implement optimizations in SQL Queries . 

**Issue**:  Task assignment is incorrect 
Solution : Check task creation API parameters, and check user assignment. Test your task management flows in the system before releasing any tasks . 

Consult online community and forum resources and the Tempo team's github page if issues cannot be debugged . We aim to respond in under 48 hours.. Report all critical vulnerabilities, with precise information so our staff can reproduce, analyze, address it. This is particularly vital during security patches.   
    
## Performance and Optimization

We prioritize optimizing the system by caching data frequently requested and optimizing complex database interactions with proper query optimizations and index management, and also using async worker processes for heavy operations,. We leverage queue processing via a dedicated cache system such as Redis for handling complex background and task processing jobs..   We can leverage hardware accelerations like using a faster network connection..  

The current implementation includes caching strategies at several layers to decrease overall system delays . Profiling using `py- profiler` reveals the system bottleneck which helps optimize code paths,. The team monitors Tempo for resource bottlenecks. The performance will be further analyzed to see improvements.. We have plans for a benchmark and stress test framework which provides automated load generation to ensure high system utilization while ensuring stability across the environment and the operating platforms we deploy upon.  

## Security Considerations

Ensure the protection of secret values (such as database credentials ) with an encrypted secure container storage, as we strongly advise not embedding those into environment parameters,. Employ robust login mechanisms (e.g. JWT, API-Key authentication ), restricting API endpoint exposure,. Always use HTTPS. 

The API server utilizes input validation. Implement strict security checks at data layer with input data, validating all incoming requests and responses to contain malicious values or code to ensure safety, preventing vulnerabilities . Apply regular patches on the underlying libraries,.  
The development staff is open to reporting issues .  A responsible disclose is welcome for identifying and handling reported problems .
