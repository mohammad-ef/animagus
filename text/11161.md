## Introduction

This repository is thriving because of contributions from amazing people and communities. Your contributions are extremely valuable! Every small suggestion, improvement, fix, or addition helps the whole project flourish, benefiting all users in the process. 

It takes dedicated developers and maintainers to create the tools we use everyday. By helping to expand functionality as new requirements arise, you directly increase the value that can be provided to users. We're incredibly grateful for everyone who participates, regardless of skillset!  

We welcome all contributions to improve the software and related community - not just code! Writing documentation, reporting issues effectively, and suggesting enhancements play a vital role. Join our journey in building the best possible tool. Let’s create something truly remarkable by collaborating and learning from each of our unique talents together. 

## Code of Conduct

All contributors, regardless of skillset, level within the project, or background commit to behaving with kindness and respect. This includes all interactions: discussions, emails, code reviews, and any other community spaces (chat servers, meetings etc.). Our community is welcoming to newcomers, and we aim to create a positive environment. 

We are dedicated to a community built on collaboration. Any form or level of harassment, or disrespectful behaviour will not be tolerated. This can encompass offensive comments or remarks targeting an individuals personal attributes or group affiliations - and it will immediately and promptly addressed, and action may be taken to enforce our policies and expectations.

If you feel that you have encountered a situation that doesn 't follow this guidance then, immediately bring to the attention of our team for investigation. Repeated violations will result disciplinary actions up to and including a ban from project involvement to guarantee a positive and welcoming environment. We encourage an atmosphere where individuals are safe and respected, contributing their skills and knowledge in a secure atmosphere. We value all members!   

## Getting Started
To set up the project locally, first ensure you have Git installed along with a working development environment compatible with our project (typically Node.js and Yarn/npm). Clone the repository from GitHub. This can be done using the following commmand:
``` git clone <repository-url> ```

Next, ` cd` into the directory. To set up the necessary local dev dependencies, please follow this step using the package manager you are using for project. For Yarn:
  ``` yarn install ```

For npm:  
``` npm install ```

Now you' can begin contributing! Create an appropriately named branch before any modification, such as ' feature/<description>'. Make any modifications, and test the changes thoroughly before submitting a change.

## How to Contribute

We welcome various forms of contributions! Reporting bugs and suggesting enhancement is extremely important, just contributing code. Improving the current documentation can make a big contribution by helping new users or developers better understand the tools. All types of involvement are encouraged in our ecosystem.

Feel encouraged to suggest a great feature that you' d like to see incorporated. It' ll improve the project' s potential. Please use issue tracking features to share ideas with the team before committing. 

Submitting code contributions can be completed by for creating a well-formed, clear, descriptive pull request. Make sure you have thoroughly reviewed and followed our coding and testing guidelines! Don’t hesitate to start a discussion early on - especially if your contribution involves substantial modifications.

To contribute through code changes, you must submit a pull request. We encourage small, focused PR that address a single, specific issue, which allows for easier code review. Don 't start large refactor unless you've discussed it and have buy-in from the project owners.

## Reporting Bugs
Before submitting a bug report, check if the problem is known by searching the issues on GitHub or by looking in community chat channels (see Communication Channels). Make sure your report contains sufficient detail.

To effectively report a bug, include details such as operating system and software versions. Providing the reproduction steps, along with the steps to replicate the issue, makes it easier to debug. If possible, try providing a simplified, runnable code snippet that can reliably reproduce the behaviour.

We use GitHub Issues (https://github.com/<organization>/<repository>/ issues for bug reporting. When creating a new issue, give it a clear and concise title. Use labels to classify the bug, which helps with categorization of issues. We encourage you to tag contributors to notify them about an issue, especially if it is a potential blocker.  

## Suggesting Enhancements

Have a fantastic idea for a new feature that would significantly expand functionality or usefulness? Great! Let' s hear about it. Suggesting enhancements can be done through the issue- tracking system.

To effectively suggest an enhancement describe the feature clearly, including the motivation for it ( why is this feature necessary?) and potential use cases. The better you can paint a picture of its utility, the easier for us to review it. We're interested in the impact the addition can have.

The maintain team evaluates suggestions based on factors such as feasibility within current technical constraints, alignment with our project goals. We may reach out to ask more questions for more details, so be sure you are actively responding to those messages. 

## Pull Request Process

Create and submit a pull request (PR) to contribute code. Make sure you're branching from your forked repository. Branch names should follow a descriptive naming convention, usually prefixed to describe the nature of change ( `feature/<something>`,  `fix/<something>` ).

Before you submit your code, use commands like the example below. This sets up a tracking change in your local repository for your pull request.
   ``` git checkout -b feature/<your-feature>``` 
   Commit all relevant modifications before pushing changes to your remote forked repositories with the following:
``` git commit -m "feat: Added new feature description" ```  
Push those changes to the server using:
```   git push  ```

Once a PR is submitted, maintain team conduct a thorough code review. Address any feedback given by maintainers or other contributors. After approval, the PR is either merged ( for small adjustments ) or squashed (for large, multiple commits).

 ## Coding Standards
Adhering to the coding standards is important. This ensures code consistency, readability, and makes maintenance significantly more manageable. Consistent indentation helps with readability, and proper naming conventions enhance understandability of codebase.

We use a linter ( ESLint ) to enforce JavaScript style guidelines automatically. Make sure you install it and configure in your environment. Type checking (TypeScript) also plays a role and is encouraged. This prevents bugs. Document all functions or public APIs clearly.

Use the existing coding style throughout the repo. This includes the proper use of semi- colon, spacing conventions, and other code elements. If there is any uncertainty, refer to the established standards.

 ## Testing Guidelines
Tests play a very important role for project stability. Make sure that your code includes tests for all new code. If you are working on a fix, create a new test that reproduces the bug and then passes after applying a fix.

Our repository is built on Jest. Familiar yourself with this framework. Use it to write Unit, and Regression to guarantee proper behavior. If you are adding new features write integration test. This ensures your features work in different scenarios.  

Run the current test before submitting a new PR. Ensure all existing tests remain green. Add test coverage. This can often identify problems in newly modified code. 

## Documentation Contributions
Clear and comprehensive documentation is vital to the usability of any tool. Contributions to documentation are highly appreciated. This is especially relevant when adding new features.

The source documentation is maintained in Markdown format ( .md ) located in the `/ docs` directory. If it' s not there, it is stored in a relevant source code files. Edit directly using Markdown editors.

Make sure you are following our style guidelines for document writing. Keep it clear, and easy to understand, and consistent in tone. When writing documents, be as concise and clear while maintaining all necessary information. Ensure documentation is up to date.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Clear, concise, descriptive commit messages greatly improve readability of the repository. This is helpful not only for the current team but future developers. Consistent commit formatting simplifies understanding of a project's evolution. 

Use the conventional commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.  Valid types include: `feat (new features)`, `fix (bug fixes)`, `docs (documentation)`, `style (code formatting)`,  `refactor (changes to code that do not impact external functionality)`, `test (adding or updating tests)`, and `chore (build process, auxiliary tools, or configuration adjustments)`. Scope is optional.

Write the subject as a concise description of the change. Use the imperative mood. Avoid ending in a period and be no longer than one line. The goal of a clear commit is to communicate intent. 

  ## Branching Model
We follow a Gitflow strategy for managing our code.  `main` is a production- stable branch that only has release- ready code on it.

Create feature branches that originate directly from `main`. When you finish developing new functionality, you' re supposed to merge it into `main` using a PR. This guarantees a streamlined workflow. 

Use the following naming conventions: feature/<description>`, `fix/<description>`, release/<version>` to describe your branch intentions. It makes it simple to identify each branch's function. This strategy guarantees consistency and simplifies code reviews. 

 ## Review Process
The maintain team reviews the pull requests. This ensures quality and adherence to coding standards. Be prepared to address feedback and make modifications as needed.

Reviewers may ask clarification or request additional tests or documentation. Please be responsive as this facilitates the review process. PR should be addressed in a timely manner for a smooth and effective workflow.

If everything appears satisfactory, the PR can be merged. This will update the target branch. If there are conflicts, resolve them before submitting the PR again. 

## Communication Channels
We use GitHub Issues for bug reports, feature suggestions, and general discussions. Join our chat channel ( [Link to Chat Channel] ) for real-time communication and collaboration.   

We are available on GitHub Issues to answer your questions and provide support. If you have a technical query, don' t hesitate to ask. This encourages a community- driven environment.  

We value respectful and open communication.

## Security Disclosure
We take security extremely seriously and value transparency. Please avoid public disclosure. Report any suspected security vulnerabilities privately and confidentially.

Contact our security team immediately at [ Security Email Address]. Provide detailed information and steps needed to reproduce. Do not disclose vulnerabilities through public channels or commit sensitive information.

We will acknowledge your report and investigate it promptly. We aim to address the vulnerability as quickly as possible and appreciate your responsible disclosure. 

## Releases
Releases are created as needed when new functionality, features, or bug fixes. New releases follow the semantic versioning approach. This is a system where the format of version number is X. Y. Z.

Each release is tagged with a version number. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with a brief description of new features, bug fixes that have been incorporated. Deploy the latest release to various platforms.
