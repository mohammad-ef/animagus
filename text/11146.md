# Simple Task Scheduler (STS) - A Python Task Execution Framework

##Description 
STS aims to simplify and automate task execution in projects requiring periodic or timed jobs. This project provides a lightweight, customizable framework for scheduling and running various scripts, functions, or processes. It supports various scheduling triggers like interval- based, cron-expressions and manual invocation providing flexibility.

STS is built using Python and leverages `asyncio` for efficient execution. It is designed to be modular and extensible allowing users to easily integrate different task types and scheduling strategies. This framework is ideal for developers who seek a straightforward method to incorporate job management in their applications, eliminating the need for complex external services.

Key features of STS encompass a task registry, scheduling mechanisms and robust retry logic. The registry provides a centralized storage system for managing tasks. Furthermore, its retry capabilities ensures resilience against temporary errors and intermittent connectivity challenges.

STS minimizes resource impact by using an event loop, and it is optimized for low- latency scheduling while providing clear logs. It supports custom tasks written in Python or can be easily extended to handle external executable files or commands.

This scheduler can also be easily integrated into various projects - from data ingestion pipelines to system monitoring. The design prioritizes easy usage for both beginner and advanced programmers. STS is a tool designed to improve project efficiency. 

## Installation Instructions

Before proceeding, you' ll require a Python 3.7 or greater.  It can be checked by typing `python3 --version` at the command prompt.

STS depends on the asynchronous programming environment in built in Python which means no explicit installation. It relies upon asyncio, a native module of Python 3.

First, create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. This command creates a new directory "venv" in your current directory and initializes the environment. `python3 -m venv venv`

Next, navigate into the newly created environment. The command `source venv/bin /activate` is used on Unix based system (macOS/ Linux) to activate the created virtual environment. For the Windows, run `venv\Scripts\activate `

Now the installation of STS can be done using pip.  The command `pip installer sts --upgrade ` will install and upgrade STS to the latest available version. It is highly encouraged to use `--upgrade`

STS relies solely on Python and does not demand the usage of any specific external packages beyond those built into the standard library.

Finally, ensure your system has write permissions to the environment to properly write the STS libraries and their requirements. Check that you're using a user-friendly editor or IDE to easily modify and execute Python code. 

## Usage Instructions

To start, you need to import the `Task Scheduler` and `Task` classes from the `sts` module. In a Python file, write: ` import sts `

Create a task by subclass from the base `Task` class. You can define a method called `run`, which is the method that will be automatically called when the task is triggered.  Example: ` class ExampleTask(sts.Task): async def run(self ): print("Running example task")`

Add the task to the scheduler using the `add_task` method.  Example: ` scheduler =  sts.Task Scheduler(); task = ExampleTask(); scheduler.add_task(task)`

Run the scheduler indefinitely with the ` run` method. This will start the scheduler and execute tasks according to their scheduled triggers. Example: ` scheduler.run()` which will start the scheduling loop.

You can also schedule a task to run at a fixed time interval using the `schedule at` method. `scheduler. schedule_at(task, "10s")` will cause the task to run every ten seconds. This offers flexibility when timing is critical for task completion.

For more advanced use, explore cron expression scheduling with `schedule_cron`. For instance, `scheduler.schedule_cron(task, "0 0 * * *")` will trigger the task every day at midnight. 
   
The STS framework is fully asynchronous. The `run` method blocks execution until the scheduler is stopped. This behavior can be modified by setting the `blocking` parameter during instantiation to false.

## Configuration

STS relies on environment variables to configure its behavior. The `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable controls the verbosity of the logging output. It can be set to 'DEBUG', 'INFO', ' WARNING', 'ERROR', or 'CRITICAL'.

By default, STS runs in a blocking fashion. To change this behavior, you can configure it through a flag to `False` in initialization like so, `TaskScheduler(blocking=False)`. The value of "blocking" parameter decides behavior of scheduler loop

STS' task execution behavior relies heavily on exception handling and error reporting. The system can configure `RETRIES` as a number of times each failed tasks attempts a retry after each attempt

Tasks' configurations include custom log formatting which are achieved through `log_formatter` configuration setting to provide custom log entries as defined through class or custom function, enhancing task execution and error management for improved troubleshooting efficiency. It supports both text format for easier debugging as well. 

Task scheduling also has options which allow to configure timeout and error thresholds for individual or a specific group.

Furthermore, it's also configured for graceful shutting down of a program. It handles tasks in order of creation by defining order to tasks that will get terminated. It prioritizes graceful closure, preventing resource waste

The framework's flexibility allows integration of diverse configurations which enables developers adapting task management according their individual and organizational workflows for consistent operations. It offers comprehensive options which enhances operational adaptability,
