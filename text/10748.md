# Project: SecureNote - A Modern Notes App with Local and Cloud Sync

## 1. Description

SecureNote is designed as a versatile notes application focusing on both local persistence and seamless cloud synchronization. Built with privacy and usability in mind, it aims to offer a streamlined environment where users store ideas, reminders, or any written thoughts with strong confidence. It allows for creating, formatting, organizing, and retrieving these notes effortlessly via a simple interface, with the crucial option for automatic backups to a user designated cloud drive, like Gdrive.

It utilizes a combination of local storage (SQLite) for core note data and a lightweight REST API (built with FastAPI) to handle secure communication with cloud storage services (specifically supporting Google Drive initially, with future expansion to other drives envisioned). The application is modular allowing for extensions that can add more cloud services or advanced features like collaborative notes.

The architecture is centered on decoupling the UI from the data and API layer. The UI, which is built with a modern frontend framework (React), interacts with the API layer via standard HTTP requests to maintain modularity. Data integrity and user safety is a core design principle.  Encryption- at- rest using user generated passwords will safeguard sensitive notes. 

Security is integral. SecureNote implements robust encryption to safeguard sensitive information. All data stored locally on- device and in cloud backups is encrypted using industry standard encryption algorithms and is protected with a users generated password which they can reset at any point. 

Ultimately, Secure Note's aim is to become the go - to application for people who value privacy, organization, and the accessibility of their notes across platforms. The focus on simplicity and security distinguishes it from more bloated note - taking applications. 

## 2. Installation Instructions

First off, make sure you meet the prerequisites. You' ll generally need Python 3.9+ installed on any supported OS. It requires a relatively recent version of the Python interpreter. If you are using Linux or MacOS you're likely to have a compatible Python interpreter available by default.

Next, we need to clone the repository.  Use the following command to clone the repository from its Git repository location onto your machine. Open your terminal and run the command:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecureNote.git
```

Then change to the project's root directory after the clone is complete. You can do this by running `cd SecureNote`. It is from here that you will start the installation process.

After you change your directory into the root project directory create a `.env` file. This file will contain environment specific variables, notably the `SECRET KEY` needed to securely interact with various parts of the application. A template can be found by executing:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open your newly created `.env` file. Fill in appropriate environment values and save. This should include an initial password hash or encryption salt value that will later become accessible to a user when they launch and use the app.  Ensure to keep this key value confidential to safeguard against malicious use.

To install all of the project requirements using pip use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On MacOS systems it could happen that some precompiled binaries cannot be automatically resolved. It would often require using the system compiler to manually handle this by doing

```bash
brew install pkg-config
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In windows using python, the process typically completes in fewer complications, especially on machines where a suitable build tool set has been automatically provisioned for.

Now the application will need SQLite to store note objects on- device for users to manage in offline settings and also in conjunction with cloud syncing functionality, it is crucial to confirm the installation is working:

```bash
sqlite3 --version
```

Lastly the React client requires node and npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
```

Alternatively with Yarn you would simply invoke:

```bash
yarn install
```

## 3. Usage Instructions

To run the API, from within the `SecureNote` directory run this command. Make sure you've properly setup your `secrets.json`. Note if your application crashes with a "Module Not Found Error", this often suggests incorrect setup:

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll need to run a frontend to use the actual note editor application which will interact via http requests with your running API server instance. Open another terminal to do so, still under the project folder, use:

```bash
npm start
```

Alternatively using yarn run would result in the invocation to start a local web application with yarn by invoking

```bash
yarn start
```

A webpage should pop-up. This page contains SecureNotes note editing application with local storage, sync with a Gdrive or eventual integration points in a similar environment with a secure key. You would create your user credentials or password here, or set up an API Key by providing Google credentials as well for syncing data.

If there are database migration issues when setting up, it's recommended you reseed or drop your database:
```bash
python scripts/migrate.py
```

Basic note editing functionality involves opening and interacting with a local text field where one may type, add rich text formats or other styling options before being written and secured locally on disk. You must be connected with cloud syncing if applicable or it is available to enable that option within SecureNotes UI for it to work correctly

## 4. Configuration

The ` .env` file in the root directory handles many core aspects of SecureNote config settings and parameters for the project as mentioned previously, but also the `configs/google_drive.json`. These configuration parameters allow developers and advanced users fine grain configuration settings. 

Google Drive authentication requires an app key which would also need proper setup in the app itself before usage, so it should ideally have some kind of setup script which will do all of this. It is not included to protect user keys as best possible in the source code of this app and to provide an initial level of user security from malicious key access

The encryption scheme utilizes a password that must be provided and securely handled by the user, this also sets an important layer to ensure that no unauthorized parties gain access without this critical component

The application supports setting custom port and address on launch through the `.env` as follows to set the listening ports. These ports and sockets can easily modified by editing `.env` files and then restarting both your React application frontend as well as Python based backend API service instance, and can be customized on deployment for different scenarios

There is no external caching currently, it can improve overall performance, which we are hoping to address at later development milestones with caching mechanisms as needed based on the load on our services and hardware constraints to improve application overall response speeds in real-world situations.

Database settings are also managed with the database configuration within our environment, it is not currently optimized but can support different databases if the schema adapts accordingly at a future implementation point as part of a future roadmap release cycle. 

The Google Cloud storage credentials and authentication is handled within your account. It should be set with care so there are proper security and safety protocols when managing cloud services with SecureNotes integrations for the users in question

## 5. Project Structure

The SecureNote project structure helps keep organization simple:

- `src/`: This folder is core. The python-based API backend server logic and modules, along with its database schemas and migrations reside in `src/` folder structure for efficient maintenance and organization.

- `client/`: This directory houses all frontend logic including Javascript modules and associated files for React and its related UI. The core React code for managing UI is also found in client

- `configs/`: The Google Drive configuration resides inside it for easy integration, adaptation for the users who may use this functionality

- `tests/`: Holds the comprehensive unit test code that is responsible for evaluating backend code's correctness for each and every feature to confirm functionality

- `scripts/`: This folder provides the utilities to manage tasks in SecureNotes project such as data migrations and seeding of dummy databases that help to avoid errors

- `.env`:  A local variable storage that helps in setting configuration settings for different development, debugging as well as staging or production deployments

- `README.md`: Contains project's detailed description

## 8. Acknowledgments

This project heavily draws from the Flask-Like FastAPI framework in developing an application backend server with API and also uses SQLAlchemy in interacting database objects to store note data in persistent format

React was leveraged heavily with the creation UI application components in building this modern note taking interface with ease. 

SQLite for providing on-device local note object storing. 

Open-source Google Drive API specifications have inspired how cloud integrations may eventually be added as extensions to our project

Thanks for every contribution, testing and valuable bug fixes. Your input helped improve quality and features!

## 9. System Architecture

The architecture consists of multiple interacting parts: UI and an underlying secure data persistence API

First, there will be our frontend application (the UI which interacts and handles presentation) built by a JavaScript library like React and a backend which consists mostly of python based APIs which will create endpoints which serve solely purposes to access a local storage of database. All requests and interactions pass over an HTTPS secured channel to protect users data in case a compromise happens to the system.

A database, SQLite stores all persistent user-owned Note objects locally in the app, as opposed to the internet and it enables access even without connection, but the option is always given by a client to automatically press to the Google-backed service and store files on a remote location

A core encryption routine that leverages user generated salts and hashes secures all the stored database files and is provided in conjunction of a backend password that must always match a valid stored encryption scheme

Finally our code uses standard API protocols which will facilitate communication in various formats, primarily through HTTPS, REST requests even if we have other integrations in other protocols like WebSockets, etc which we could introduce to extend capabilities

## 10. API Reference

The core API consists of several end points that interact directly with database persistence

* **`/notes`**: `GET`. Retrieve all the user's note list or objects and it also handles POST method.

* **`/notes/{id}`**: Retrieves specific note based on id provided by GET Method as it handles POST, PATCH to change data on a certain id, PUT for replacement purposes.
  `GET` : Get a specified Note based off an ID passed

* **`/users`**: This route creates users or authenticates them, as it involves user data persistence with secure keys as part of user identity

  `POST`: Register/add New User with initial data

These end points will have corresponding authentication protocols for users so it may not have a wide array or unauthorized users that attempt data theft, data manipulation in ways that is uncalled or unexpected from a secure data-oriented application as intended to operate and be implemented as part of our roadmap release schedule

## 11. Testing

Tests can be invoked using standard command to invoke unit test framework. It can often involve a `pytest` invocation from command prompt:
```bash
pytest
```

Tests run across several layers which cover backend API calls for data CRUD, database integrity to verify data schema consistency across migrations in order to safeguard related objects and relationships in our persistent layer and end-to-end user interaction flows

We have mocked several key integrations for the backend such as API Keys as libraries for ease. The React component also utilizes test utilities in its test to mock interactions. 

Ensure all code includes proper coverage with test cases. This should also cover edge scenarios, and invalid conditions that the program might experience. This helps to guarantee code quality.

## 12. Troubleshooting

If facing connection issues to the Google Cloud service and your notes aren 't getting properly synced or authenticated then check the `secrets.json` is configured. Verify it properly stores the right authentication information and is not compromised in some fashion that affects your data flow. 

A typical module " not found " error indicates an unresolvable python requirement or a package version mismatch or missing packages in a system's package directory

When dealing with local database inconsistencies. Ensure all migration processes have executed appropriately to prevent conflicts, otherwise perform migrations to correct and resync all local state. You would have to seed or remove it to fix issues and resync it with the backend database layer if running into this

## 13. Performance and Optimization

The code has a relatively basic structure. To further enhance speed performance, you'd ideally introduce cacheing on both front end side using local client or the server side. It does involve an additional complexity but it does provide benefits to a high throughput scenario for large datasets

For cloud operations you'll ideally need to explore batch API calls to enhance Google storage operation efficiencies as a possible extension

For the future it will include concurrent database interactions to improve performance on scaling up with increasing database objects and interactions that will increase as time continues. 

The UI should use pagination on list of Note views and lazy load data to reduce memory impact, as that is a single-handedly largest contributor when it pertains the frontends overall speed on performance

## 14. Security Considerations

It 's highly recommend not including your credentials directly. Utilize secure environment files. This should never exist as an embedded part in source, which can increase the likelihood of compromise by unauthorized third- parties, malicious agents in the case they get code from repositories. 

Ensure user password are properly secured by storing password hashesh and salts to mitigate risks

Input Validation and sanitize user supplied values and content from a potential source such malicious data to prevent exploits, SQLi or other security flaws

Regularly monitor all services for known vulnerability by applying updates or hot patches from relevant service to prevent exploitation. Always review security updates from Google as soon as they appear as Google has an expansive and trustworthy service and ecosystem in which this relies for its operation 

## 15. Roadmap

*   Support additional cloud drives (Dropbox, OneDrive). Planned release by late December, 2024
*   Collaboration and share note function - early Q1, 2025 
*   Advanced Text Editing (Markdown or richer options)
*   Refactoring database schema for scaling. - by June 2025, pending funding for further expansions and feature sets as required 
*   Implement a search and indexing features

## 16. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

I forgot my password? Use recovery mechanisms. Secure Notes can provide recovery keys and instructions on restoring access, ideally in a secure location that the User would retain control to safeguard against compromise of data in data loss event or account compromises 

How does the Google API connection works and authentication flow in this system: You provide a service credentials and an access keys that authenticate a secure and authenticated API flow that is used to monitor files. The service credentials must remain private for safety.
Why could database issues and migration error messages manifest? Inconsistent filenames could create issues during migrations or incorrect file types or permissions could manifest to problems and database objects could not correctly synchronize to ensure integrity and prevent unexpected loss and damage to files in data management.
Where should a key/ secret to be safely saved for a user account to secure a system from unauthorized parties
