# Contributors Guildeline

## ** 1.Introduction **

We warmly invite you  to contribute!  Your involvement is instrumental in helping us evolve our codebase and shape the future of project. By adding your expertise, you are directly supporting our project's goals.   

Contributions are vital for maintaining a dynamic, reliable , and innovative platform. Whether you' are a seasoned programmer or have a keen eye for detail in documentation, your skills matter.

 We welcome contributions of every kind:  code changes , documentation refinements, issue investigations , and design ideas.  Let’s work to achieve our common objective of creating a great software experience together!

## 2 . Code of Conduct

To cultivate a positive and inclusive community, we ask that everyone abide. Respectful communication is at the heart of our interactions - listen actively, and avoid making assumptions or offensive remarks. Collaboration is key and we value diversity. 

We commit to creating a welcoming, harassment free environment for everyone involved with the project, regardless of experience, skills, race or any other personal characteristics . We expect this standard of behavior and from contributors.

Any behavior that undermines our community, like bullying , insults, or demeaning comments, or any form of harassment, will be addressed.  Repeat offenders will face temporary or permanent exclusion from the project.

## 3. Getting Started

First, fork the repository on GitHub to your own account and clone the forked repository to your local machine. Then, create a new branch named with a descriptive identifier for your work, like `feature / new-feature`.

After cloning, you'll likely need to install necessary dependencies. For projects with `requirements.txt`,  use `pip install - r - requirements.txt`. Other project structures may have their own instructions so consult them as well..

Next you should build the project to ensure its operational. This might entail commands like `npm run build `, `make `, or similar depending on project type.  Refer to project documentation for more instructions.   

To test and run project locally, follow the documentation in the README.md. Ensure your local build is operating correctly. This step is important. 

Once setup, regularly fetch the latest changes from the original repository ( `git pull upstream main`) to stay synchronized while working on your branch. This will prevent merge conflicts.  

Finally, ensure you have configured your Git environment with your name and email address to correctly attribute your contributions. Use:  `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and ` git confg --global user.email "youremail@example.com"`.   

## 4. How to Contribute

Many avenues are available in our project; reporting issues, suggesting enhancements, contributing new feature implementations, or simply making our project documentation even more user- friendly are some possibilities .

Submitting clear bug and feature proposals will help maintainers better understand your needs and prioritize work. Detailed, well-articulated requests are more likely to be actioned effectively by maintainers.

Before starting extensive code modifications, we encourage you to initiate a conversation with the project maintainers about your intent . This will help align work and minimize potential conflicts.

If you find a bug that has not already been reported, please open an issue detailing the steps to reproduce it, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. Be as specific as possible!

Feature requests should also be opened as separate issues, detailing the purpose, potential use cases, and any design considerations or alternative solutions you might have considered.

For improvements in documentation, submit pull requests directly with the modified content.  Small improvements are welcome!

## 5 . Reporting Bugs

When describing a bug, please start by providing a concise summary to give the maintainers a sense of the problem. Next, clearly describe the steps you took in order to reproduce the bug. This is important to enable us to understand and verify issue.    

Be sure to include the actual result that occurred as opposed to what you expect should happen, providing specific details on what you noticed was unusual or unexpected during runtime . If applicable provide logs and/or stack traces, they may be valuable! 

To make bug reproduction easy, strive to provide the simplest and smallest, working, reproducible case (a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example or MCVE). This is immensely helpful for maintainers debugging problems .

Please check to confirm the same bug hasn 't already been submitted on the issue tracker to avoid creating redundant records,  If found , react on it instead to keep it centralized for tracking resolution and follow ups!

## 6 . Suggesting Enhancements

We always love a well formed, considered enhancement suggestions . When suggesting enhancements or new features describe their motivations.  Tell us what problem are trying to solve for various types users. What is their intended use and who stands toward it! 

Providing potential user scenarios for a new enhancement or modification makes understanding its context significantly smoother . Include examples, user workflows,  and/or specific user requests to highlight value .

Feature ideas, once proposed , enter an review phase with existing team and developers involved and prioritized by their feasibility , usefulness for users or project goals , and existing ongoing tasks and timelines . Don\'t be dismayed for it is common. 

Consider alternative designs which you can discuss during enhancement request, it could help in improving overall solution, and we welcome such open discussions to enhance overall outcome !   

Don 't feel you're constrained from sharing ideas even they aren 't fully fleshed. We believe every input holds possible to evolve something valuable in future releases , hence we welcome dialog for productive evolution ! 

## 7. Pull Request Process

Before submitting pull requests , make sure the changes have a related issue and the title matches a relevant reference like: '[#IssueNum] Bugfix/New-Function'.   Branch should start in feature and prefix to make easy identify. For new implementation:   `git checkout -b feature/new-api` and `fix`: `git checkout -b fix/authentication-vulnerability`.  

Always base pull requests from the `main` branch for the highest integration success. Ensure to sync local repo to avoid divergence by fetching remote upstream regularly:  `git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main` . Resolve potential merges conflicts if arise and address it carefully..

Before committing ensure code adheres the code guidelines mentioned earlier with style checkers like pylint. Include new/modifications for all the changes. Add comments if necessary so other collaborators understand logic behind implementation decisions !   

Your code review should pass by the maintainers . They review, give comments or suggestions, if approved will perform the merging. 

After a successful PR, the pull request branch could either merge and get closed and the work will integrated .

## 8. Coding Standards

We use `pep8` standard to promote code style uniformity, and code consistency is paramount within project for collaborative maintenance . Indentation, and use whitespace in code must follow PEP8 guidelines to improve readability and prevent unexpected behaviours in execution! 

Consistent and understandable naming conventions help with maintenance; variable names and method must reflect clearly the functionality that is performing! Follow conventions for data structure to enhance overall readability.

Linters should ideally integrate and perform on your code base to ensure code conforms to standards! Static Analysis such like Mypy are also highly valuable . 

Adhere closely when creating and adding code. All new changes and modifications must contain appropriate documention in form comments or docstrings for easier navigation and usage of new features

All contributions will be tested, reviewed , and adhere to our standards to guarantee the stability and maintainability project . Any code that falls to follow standard won 't accepted into our repo without modifications that align!

## 9. Testing Guidelines

Existing unit test and/or test scripts need running after making a PR and confirm passing before sending it off , ensuring existing functional is unaffected! This step calls automated testing to catch issues.   

New test coverage should added as part of new changes, especially critical functionality and error pathways for improved project safety ! Unit, functional, integrations are important testing categories and all welcome!

When contributing, new testing frameworks must conform existing project standards to maintain consistent testing environment and reduce dependencies for other developers and CI . Ensure to include tests with the same repo as implementation to promote modular integration!   

We strongly support TDD approach; Test driven design. Where new functions, methods written based off defined expectations, to help catch any logical mistakes in coding phase . Test must always execute before submitting PR! 

Test code need to follow standards, like `PEP8`, proper comments describing the functionality tested! All the tests have been well organized into directories for easy navigations when working .   

## 10. Documentation Contributions

Any documentation changes, whether to conceptual documentation for API references can all made through documentation. Update files in `/docs` directory for any modification and ensure proper build processes.

When incorporating edits always make changes using same tools as existing project documentation for maintain style consistency. If documentation tools and/processes haven defined in setup , please refer documentation.

Maintain clear descriptions , diagrams, illustrations in documentation; all intended user and development should understand and easily find answers and information! All changes should have comments explaining what changes have implemented .

When creating or editing docs always verify for correctness; accuracy matters, especially regarding things technical or implementation details to make sure user have accurate info at the ready!.  Ensure to follow existing conventions!   

Always consult current version for information before modifying, it help keep all the users informed about expected behaviours, functionalities and interfaces !   

## 11. Commit Message Guidelines

Each commits message has title that briefly explains the scope or change involved , following format of: type: Description and can follow the format from conventional commits ( feat:, fix:, doc : ), refactor, test,.  

Commit messages needs concise summaries which provide sufficient info for others understand why a modification occurred, even retrospectively, to quickly find information and navigate changes made in source! This helps team and collaborators! 

Consistent messages makes reviewing, and debugging more easy!  This improves efficiency by streamlining the information that is passed from commit messages during PR, debugging and review cycles

Using descriptive titles improves ability in finding and analyzing change. Clear titles are also valuable as project history and future development and maintenance . All titles have length restrictions (72) to enhance visibility.

Commit bodies should explain details, motivation, design considerations , alternative choices.  All should provide a clear justification that provides the broader project team with understanding . All messages follow standard and convenitions!.

## 12. Branching Model

The current version is based Gitflow for branching and release, to ensure efficient parallel develop with production releases stability, where feature branch branching from the dev or `main` is common and used frequently for development !   

New work starts in a new `feature/*` , `fix/* `or any descriptive identifiers to easily understand branch intent ! This makes tracking feature developments simple!    

`main` always contains a released and deployable stable release, while development work goes inside `develop`, which periodically is tagged or released! It's common!

Longer living feature branches may consider rebasing onto the dev to prevent conflicts or divergence and ensure easy merge with  the develop branches and allow easy merge. Always rebase! 

For releases , branch from `develop` into a release branches , test for final quality checks then merges to  main after approval is achieved ! Always tag with the proper releases number ! 

## 13. Review Process

Maintainers carefully scrutinize PR  before merge for correctness and adherence of guidelines ! It ensures stability of projects! Maintainers review and comment and give valuable insight ! 

Feedback should given in respectful, professional , helpful tones! Be receptive comments. It helps improving code! All PR need clear, understandable explanation !

Response timely and engaged in the reviews is highly regarded ! All suggestions are taken as feedback. All discussions help in resolving issues ! It enhances understanding between contributors.   

Merge decision depends on passing all quality gates tests as well reviewed. If issues identified, will ask to rebase with new comments to resolve any conflicts!.
