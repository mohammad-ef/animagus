# contributing guidelines

##1\. Introduction

We're thrilled about your interest in joining us! The health and vibrancy of our project rely on the contributions of our open source supporters.  Your contributions, no matter the amount, make an enormous positive difference by helping us to build, maintain, and innovate, and ultimately serve as more effective software for a larger user base. 

We strongly believe a strong community is built on collaboration, inclusivity ,and diverse skillsets. That's why we value all types of contributions, from coding features to improving the documentation, helping to answer questions, or simply spreading the word. This document aims to guide you on how you can best contribute and get involved with our project.

We welcome contributors of all skill and background levels. Don’t be hesitant to reach out with questions, offer suggestions for improvements, or even just provide feedback on how we can create an even better contribution environment.

 ##2\. Code of Conduct

To foster a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive community, every person interacting with this community must respect the dignity, autonomy, and rights to safety of all other individuals. We expect respectful communication and a collaborative spirit from all participants. 

Harassment, discrimination, or any other conduct that compromises a comfortable and inclusive environment is explicitly prohibited and will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, insults, threats, or any form of harassment based on identity, background, or skill level of a person. We will enforce this code. Violations may lead to suspension or permanent ban from this project, depending on the seriousness of the offense.

We strongly encourage everyone to report any concerns or violations they encounter through the appropriate channels (see "Communication Channels" below).  Remember - a supportive and open atmosphere is crucial for a thriving open-source community, and you're instrumental in creating it.

##3\. Getting Started

To get started, the most important thing to do is fork the repository on GitHub. After forking, clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <your_fork_url>`. This creates your local working copy of the project, allowing you to make changes. It is recommended to create a new branch off `main `for all your new work, using `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`, for easier integration into the primary repository. 

Ensure you have the required tools installed. The project typically requires [insert required programming language e. g., Python, Node.js, Go] and [insert other dependencies e.g., specific libraries, a database]. Refer to a `README.md` or `SETUP GUIDE` to determine all prerequisites and setup instructions.

You can then run the project locally to confirm your environment setup. For instance, to build the project, you might type `npm install` if Node.js is required, or `make build` if a Makefile exists. If the project requires a server to run properly, ensure to configure the appropriate environment variables, and start it with command `python server.py` for a python project or  `node server.js` for Node.js.

##4\. How to Contribute 

We welcome diverse ways to contribute to the project beyond just coding. Reporting bugs, suggesting features, improving documentation, and answering questions on the forum can be equally valuable in strengthening our product. Always try to start your development journey by thoroughly researching the issue or functionality within existing files and codebase to understand it before jumping to conclusions or starting a PR.

For significant changes or major features, it may be advantageous to first propose a design concept through the issues.  Describe the problem and proposed solution to discuss its feasibility and integration into our system, preventing potential time loss and conflicts later. Openness, clear documentation and thoughtful conversation are critical.

Remember: even fixing typos or updating documentation makes an important difference! Contributing also can mean spreading the word and engaging the larger user community and inviting additional collaborators! The best place to begin exploring is usually the `Issues` tab or through our online discussion channel, as they are great resources and points for interaction with maintainers and fellow users!

##5\. Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a bug report, thoroughly examine existing issues to see whether it may already be filed and addressed or under review. A descriptive issue title makes for much more helpful reporting than simply a brief title! Once verified, open a new issue and describe the issue clearly.  Be as precise as possible regarding environment information like versions, configuration setup, the expected behaviour vs actual results observed, along with relevant error messages, and screenshots (where relevant).

Include steps on how to reproduce the issue. If reproducible by running commands with input values to recreate a situation or error, it makes our bug investigation far easier. It would include all of steps necessary so that any team member could step-through it, reproduce the scenario in their development environment, diagnose the core root issue and work toward recovery, with the lowest potential for ambiguity.

The more precise and helpful you are, the more effectively your bug report will assist the development team to diagnose and solve the underlying problems. Always submit all your new reported concerns to our project GitHub issues page to help our maintenance team stay organized.

##6\. Suggesting Enhancements

Do you have an idea to improve the software, or to introduce a useful feature to enhance capabilities? We love it and want to hear all your creative proposals and feedback! Create a new issue labeled appropriately ("feature request").

When proposing a new feature, clearly motivate why it benefits the product. Include a thorough description about your feature's use cases and who will specifically be able to take advantage of this capability and how, as this provides vital information for prioritization decisions and ensures that new additions provide value. It can also involve outlining what challenges the user faces and explain precisely how a solution you describe alleviates it and creates more streamlined user interaction with a software tool. 

Please keep in mind that we are limited to a specific resource allocation schedule to ensure continual progress toward core inititives. The enhancement may not align immediately to what's being planned, but our teams always value thoughtful contribution and will consider and weigh new ideas during prioritization roadmaps planning discussions!

##7\. Pull Request Process

After developing your contribution locally and pushing your changes to your forked repository, initiate a Pull Request from your fork against the main repository or the `develop` branch - this can vary per the team workflow preferences outlined. Please adhere to the project's coding standards as described within Section 8 for code formatting to ease and facilitate integration and minimize review cycle duration!

Create meaningful and informative commit messages. Branch names should be descriptive. A naming pattern that begins with a prefix is recommended (i.e., `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/resolve-problem`), to make it obvious what problem a change seeks to remedy. A detailed title and summary are crucial, along with descriptions about each significant piece of change you implemented in this iteration to make reviewing the submission easy.

Maintainers will review your PR. Feedback could request clarifications or changes in coding style/structure or other concerns to align contributions along team best practices to keep our overall coding standard unified. Address comments constructively, pushing updated changes back onto the Pull Request as soon as practical, which triggers the reviewers into being notified again for continued discussion, testing, and integration until final approval! Once it satisfies the maintainer, you will have it approved, merged to target branches to become integrated!

##8\. Coding Standards

Code style uniformity makes collaboration much easier. Follow these principles for consistency and improved code clarity and maintainability within all project code segments. Ensure proper code style is enforced with an established code linters like Prettier and eslint (for JavaScript and TypeScript).  Follow the existing indentation conventions within all file sections - usually, two spaces and tabs must always be forbidden.

We strongly enforce static code analysis. We utilize linters such as Flake8 for Python code.  Adherence will ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability within our overall product. Also utilize style and formatting conventions, naming patterns to promote better organization and code readability - for Python follow guidelines like PEP 8!

##9\. Testing Guidelines

Thoroughly testing is integral for delivering high-quality stable releases of all versions to meet end-user requirements and expectations. Ensure you're familiar with testing standards within a specific project by consulting relevant `TESTS` folders/modules. Run any existing automated unit tests with command  `pytest`  to assess previous functionalities. Add new automated tests that address changes that cover a full array of situations for comprehensive coverage - for Python `pytest --cov=module` is recommended.

We recommend creating tests using frameworks, mirroring existing patterns within code sections, like pytest and Mock in Python! We value tests as the first defense mechanism and want tests integrated at different granularity - at minimum, each change you introduce to codebase warrants a dedicated testing block for that code section for comprehensive regression protection from bugs or unwanted impacts that occur when code interacts or merges between elements and/or sections within larger projects.

##10\. Documentation Contributions

Improving project documentation directly benefits users, contributors, and maintenance crew alike. To maintain our knowledge sharing practices within documentation, submit changes through a dedicated folder or subdirectories, typically located inside the  `docs`  repository segment, or directly via editing `README` file for initial onboarding documentation and basic project overview information!

Keep existing information clear, correct, concise and current; always meticulously proof-read any new/amended entries for proper grammar or syntax or formatting mistakes - these details are vital to ensure user comprehension! Be aware the documentation follows existing styles within existing documents as that facilitates easy navigation, search and discovery, while creating unified user experience across multiple documentation resources or sections available to a community of end-users!

##11\. Commit Message Guidelines

Clear, concise commit messages enhance readability for everyone involved by ensuring easy comprehension about past project developments, which enables easier tracking down and fixing issues as the system matures with runtime evolution of features! We adopt "conventional commits," following the style prefix such as:   `fix: brief explanation of fix` or  `feat: Add this new thing`

Ensure messages adhere these formatting rules and use descriptive and meaningful verbs, such as add, delete, change to properly reflect what actions your commit introduced and what it impacts or addresses to ensure the message communicates what your commit achieves within project codebase segments and their interactions across different code components. A detailed and precise explanation for why you introduced change is critical.  Well structured commits enable faster issue investigation for all project participants!

##12\. Branching Model

We adopt a standard branching workflow that allows team developers and individual community participants collaborate seamlessly! This includes using separate dedicated branching strategy that allows multiple development and review activities running alongside.  All code work happens from feature/fix branching originating at a primary branch. `Main`  or equivalent primary version, remains dedicated exclusively with only the release versions - which should reflect only stable product versions with zero risk or potential to create conflicts with running user code and operations!

Always make a new branch from `main` whenever possible! For smaller features or minor fixes use dedicated naming conventions, such as:  `feature/short-summary-feature`. Avoid directly making commits onto a production/stable/base branch as that can destabilize and cause unintended disruptions to current running code operations - use the feature branching to enable code changes to pass rigorous code analysis before they get fully committed to core version code segment, as it reduces potential disruptions to user experiences while improving the quality code.

##13\. Review Process

Pull request code undergoes rigorous review processes prior merge! Our core review crew will inspect, comment, discuss with authors on the potential issues/improvements to achieve best standards in product codebase, before fully merging to codebase and releasing a newer software build with updated feature and changes to community end-users or clients who leverage this code! We appreciate users engaging respectfully within reviews while being mindful/sensitive regarding team best standards as that improves efficiency across entire review pipeline.

Provide thorough responses - even on comments which seem irrelevant to help facilitate the understanding for all stakeholders, by providing clarifications and details regarding reasoning that guided the implementation. The team anticipates and will strive respond with actionable/meaningful feedback in the fastest possible time-bound while respecting code-segment complexities/intricacies, within the reasonable window-frames and adhere timelines that team has previously set, as to facilitate smooth development process - with zero disruptions for community developers or internal development members.

##14\. Communication Channels

Stay up-to-date with all ongoing activities and collaborate effectively. Use GitHub Issue tracker for formal feature suggestions or reporting concerns about project bugs that needs resolution or addressing to enhance overall quality - or create/report potential vulnerabilities, for optimal transparency within community! For general discussion, quick questions or collaborative problem solving consider utilizing dedicated Slack group. Link is: [Slack Group URL].  

Feel free and encouraged join online community, ask any open and constructive discussions that promote a thriving community environment.  Be always respectful within the discussions to facilitate and encourage positive community developments, for overall growth, expansion and improvements, and create welcoming, inclusive space within development communities to invite additional members and contributors from different skillsets backgrounds. Engage and participate actively to contribute positive impacts within a thriving and inclusive ecosystem within community participants across various backgrounds, expertise/levels.

##15\. Security and Responsible Disclosure

If you suspect or encounter any security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL Injection, or related risks in any codebase or product areas) it must get immediately communicated. Refrain publicly exposing/announcing details before giving team/developers a timely, fair, appropriate chance to mitigate vulnerabilities! Reach to our secure team channel [secure.channel] to enable safe/responsible/confidential communications regarding these security issues, so the teams could properly address these problems to secure product from any attacks - for community well-being & user confidence & trust! 

Do always communicate with our designated contacts before making it to wider-audiences or general media to allow sufficient opportunity to address potential breach/vulnerabilities. This is to minimize damage and maximize protection, so a collective and proactive approach to maintain community integrity - by enabling responsible and safe communications. Remember - proactive collaboration and transparent communication with team developers are crucial aspects when it concerns maintaining security!

##16\. Release Process

Release cycle typically consists with tagging code base and version update in code repositories. After the changes pass all rigorous tests, a release will get initiated. Changelog entries accurately capture all the modifications made in that version with descriptions.  This will get updated and synchronized on release day across project documentation/distribution points and repositories. 

Follow conventional-commit semantic conventions, when applicable for proper software development practices to help with automated build systems & automated versioning tools for efficient build pipeline, release and update processes. Adhere and follow version-based release schedules that help maintain a predictable, structured cadence within the software releases!

##17\. Recognition

The project acknowledges the vital contribution from each and everyone within development/support team/ community members who dedicate time, effort in creating robust, stable version - so everyone will have proper visibility to all the important contribution! The contributions and their names are publicly credited/shown on contributors-listings within the website as a sign of community-level participation to foster an active/supportive/engaged open source project - as to incentivize/enable additional developers joining this initiative and to help maintain and scale a growing ecosystem for long run sustainability and expansion across diverse backgrounds skills- and experiences.

##18\. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This steps ensure all contributors are in alignment of license pertaining intellectual rights, for all submitted source files within repository to prevent conflicts or legal ramifications! All developers need a formal license, so to clearly articulate legal responsibilities/author rights/intellectual rights pertaining project and source contributions for community. You should carefully go thru, if applicable before participating. Link-provided: [CLA document URL]. This enables clear alignment between the contributors to the project's ownership.

##19\. Resources and References

Keep current regarding evolving standards to enhance overall product quality within a community driven development! Refer and leverage resources for code guidelines - [link- PEP 8 guidelines for code styling and information];  Consult developer resources documentation for detailed guides -[link for relevant docs]. Also review existing style guidelines to facilitate unified coding across project contributors!
