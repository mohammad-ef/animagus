## Background

This printer was recieved for free as a contest win and has provided many, many hours of amusement in tweaking, extending, and printing. It's been an absolute workhorse with thousands of hours of printing time on it; defying all odds given the A8's original reputation.

Huge thanks goes out to the Anet A8 user community for helping to understand and fix all the safely issues and functional weaknesses presented by a 3D printer made with only a low price point in mind.
