## Installation Instructions

Prerequisites to installing Tempo are having Docker and Compose installed on target machine. Make sure these are properly setup and working before attempting the Tempo installation. This allows the software deployment and execution in isolated containerized environments. These tools are available for various platforms - please follow platform- specific setup steps on the respective websites for proper functioning. 

Next you should clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github... (replace with project url)
cd Tempo
```  
This clones the Tempo source code repository, which includes all the required files and directory for the project. Make sure git is installed and working to properly fetch the repo contents into local machine. It' is recommended that you create local branch for development purposes before installing.  

The next step is to create a `.env` configuration in the `deploy` directory, as per the requirements of docker- compose. The file will need at least a password for database and admin user.
```bash   
touch .env
nano .env
```
You will then need to edit the file with values appropriate for production or test. For a production setup, ensure these are robust and securely encrypted.  

Now the installation is almost complete. It' is required now to build all the required docker images using `docker-compose`. The docker commands are executed from Tempo root directory. The Docker Compose tool will manage the entire build and deployment pipeline.

Building the image requires that you have access to internet for retrieving external dependencies during process. It is possible to download these ahead of time to minimize build process duration, especially in offline environments.
``` bash
docker-compose build
```

After build has finished we can bring everything up using the following:
``` bash
docker - compose up - d
```
It is recommended using `- d` in production setup. This launches container and runs them in background. It is useful when running multiple processes at a time. It allows the Tempo to run in the background. 

To view container logs you could execute command
  ``` bash
 docker-compose logs <service_name>
   ```
 Replace `<service_ name` with the specific microservice that you are investigating for errors. This can be a very efficient way to track down problems. 

Finally, to check that Tempo is running, navigate to ` http:// localhost 8000` and you should see the login page to create an account or login with admin. If everything has been configured correctly it should be possible to login as the default admin user, with password set in `. env` file.  

For macOS user, use `brew cask install docker` before running. On Window users please use Docker Desktop instead of direct docker CLI. This will simplify the install experience. For some Linux distros, additional packages are often necessary.

## Usage Instructions

To begin, create an account or access as administrator with the username and password provided during setup (specified during the `deploy/.env ` file creation). After that, start by creating your first project. You can do so by logging in and going to ` Projects ` menu and clicking on button ` Create Project.` 

Then you should be able to create individual tasks under a specific project. Each task can be assigned a priority (High, Medium, Low ) and an estimated completion time. The UI provides a drag-and- drop mechanism for easy task ordering. The user can also set deadlines, add descriptions, and assign tasks to team members.

To view all pending tasks, navigate to ` Tasks ` in the navigation bar. This will display a list of all open tasks from all your projects, filtered by priority or deadlines. You are also presented with a search bar allowing filtering. This enables you to efficiently track overall progress. 

For advanced users API can be used via a REST API. All endpoints are documented at `/api/docs `, and can be accessed from the main Tempo application. API is authenticated by an API key. Generate it by logging in, navigate and select `Settings -> API`

Tempo offers several command-line tools that can be used to perform administrative tasks. For example, the `manage.py` script can be utilized to perform database migrations. It should be run within the Tempo environment.

You may customize Tempo using configuration files within ` configs` folder to adjust system parameters, API keys, database settings , and security policies based on project needs. These configuration files can easily be overridden during environment variable settings for dynamic adaptation. 

To view task progress in real-time, use the " Dashboard " view. This interface offers visualizations of your workload distribution. Progress bars and charts illustrate the current status of all projects and tasks. The UI will dynamically adjust the display when new tasks are complete.   

To export your task data for use by other software packages or to maintain archives for historical tracking , use export functions. Data can be exported to CSV or JSON, enabling seamless integration with different applications. 

The platform supports integration with third-party tools using webhooks. When task status or priority are changed, the system can notify external services or automate other workflow processes. The webhooks will allow for seamless and flexible workflows.  

For team members you could assign a new task by going to `Project -> Tasks` and using the "Assignee" field. The assigned user will be automatically notified of the task assigned in the notifications menu. Notifications can also be turned off in the settings section of each users preferences.   

To test performance of the system load test tools such as J Meter could be used. It could simulate hundreds or millions of users at a time providing useful data. This information could be useful for optimizing Tempo.

## Configuration

Tempo primarily uses environment variables and configurations files in `deploy/.env` for customization purposes. This modular approach provides flexibility to configure different deployments based on varying needs.  

Key environment variables include `DATABASE_ URL`, `REDIS_ URL`, API keys, and ` SECRET_KEY` for session encryption. It is critical that the `DATABASE_URL` and ` REDIS_URL` are configured for your specific database and redis setup.

Configuration files can override environment variables. The configuration files are stored within directory ` configs`. It contains settings for the frontend, backend, and other related components. It is recommended that you modify these files only when required. The file format is ` YAML`.  

The `SECRET_KEY` is critical security consideration. Ensure you use a strong, randomly generated key for session encryption, which protects the user data. Store it securely and do not commit it into version control.

Optional parameters can be passed via environment variables to configure features like email notifications, third-party integrations, and advanced logging. The availability of these configuration settings can vary depending on specific microservices.

For example, to configure the frontend, edit `configs/frontend. yaml`. This will affect appearance and functionality within the front end web application. To configure the backend edit `configs/backend. yaml `.

Tempo also supports custom themes using the theme management system within the frontend. To change the theme you go to ` User Settings -> Theme` and choose from a predefined list. Custom theme files can be added by modifying the `theme ` folder.

For performance optimization consider configuring caching options in the database and Redis, adjusting buffer sizes, and enabling concurrency settings.  The specific settings will depend upon the workload of the Tempo deployment environment. 

The logging configuration can be customized for detailed debugging and error tracking. You can configure different log levels, destinations, and output formats using the environment variables. Proper log rotation is critical to avoid the disk space issues when deployed to the production systems.   

Security settings can be customized in the `config/ security.yaml` file. Enable additional security features like CSRF protection and input validation. Regularly review security updates and apply necessary patches.   

When deploying to different environments use different configuration files. This will ensure your configurations are appropriately setup for each environment. You can also use environment variables to dynamically override some configuration files settings based on deployment conditions..

## System Architecture

Tempo follows a microservices architecture, promoting independent scalability, deployability, and team-specific responsibility and autonomy.

At the front lies ` Tempo - Frontend` , a  ` ReactJS ` Application responsible only user presentation through web interface

Next there ` Backend Services`: a cluster consisting `Authentication, Users, Task`, etc, built upon python with  `Flask `. Services interact primarily via the redis messaging bus which facilitates loose connection between services to enhance system resilience as the services fail to impact neighboring services. This architecture ensures services scale in a timely fashion and independent.   

Database `Postgres`, serves a role persistence data. The database stores critical task-relevant user, project configurations

A key concept here being data separation across microservice which manage independent database to maintain autonomy.. 

Overall workflow involves front requesting resources from backend APIs and backend service processes these request through internal logic to return data and respond via REST. 

Data-Flow follows as: Front-> REST-Backend Service -> Message queue ( Redis )- -> BackendService - -> PostgreDB -> Back End Serice (reverse path)- ->Front end viaREST   
   
Dependencies primarily include ` Flask ` framework on Backend ,  Postgre database on Persistence , Docker &Docker Compose containerizing environment , &Redis Clustering . The micro service architecture facilitates independent scalability &deployment for efficient asset allocation .

This architecture enables easy to expand new services while maintaining system robustness and performance, a vital characteristic when building modern platforms for productivity purposes .

## API Reference

Tempo` exposes extensive APIs, primarily through its Backend microservice which adheres REST architecture principles

Endpoint for Authentication (Login ) -   `POST `/api/login`, parameters (username & assessment)

Endpoints For user profiles  `-GET  /api/:username ` returns details

Task API endpoints-

`- POST `/api/task - ` Create task ` Parameters : title task_ descritpr priority

` PUT api / Task/:TaskId `-Update Task

GET API - GET `/ Task`: list

DELETE  api / tasks: : id':'

` - Get ` - `/ api -/Task/ id

`  For project APIs `  
` - Create new project`:
  `- `

API calls return responses of standard `json `, adhering REST architecture best practicies
All requests require valid Authentication from API

Example Request ( creating Task ) -   ( POST ` api/ task ` - headers with Authorization)   
   `-  Request:   JSON` - body { ` task_ name`, 'priority','project-ID `}   
  response :  { "success : `TRUE`, "task ID":"246232"}   .

## Testing

The core goal is robust test cases covering critical functions. The system uses unit and end-to-end integration frameworks that are used.   

Unit tests, run automatically using  pytest, cover individual components within services. They aim isolate code to verify core business logics without relying on any dependencies or environments
For Integration test using Mocking environment is crucial and that is why it implemented before launch of each service

To launch Unit & Integrato Test , run:
 ```bash 
   python run_ test - test all . py. ```    
The command is launched within  the project environment

For E2E Tests we leverage selenium which simulates user interactions on the front end

E2E tests cover full flow including authentication login. These run using command

 - run"-test"-e-test

For running the whole testing framework we provide simple test scripts in test.yml
