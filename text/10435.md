# Contributors Guildeline

## ** 1.Introduction **

We warmly invite you  to contribute! Your participation, regardless of size, helps our community thrive and improves our shared project. Every contribution, from small fixes to new feature, helps us build and sustain a vibrant community for everyone.

Contributing isn 't limited to just code. Documentation updates, test coverage improvements, and thoughtful feature suggestions, as valuable, so we are happy to see contributions of those type and value them, too. 

We encourage a welcoming open source experience, where every voice is heard, and all contributions are valued!

 ## ** 2.Code-of-Conduct **

This project is committed  to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone who contributes. We expect all participants, whether you are a seasoned veteran, or a new starter, to be respectful, collaborative, open to diverse experiences, perspectives and skills and avoid disrespectful interactions, offensive comments, or any form of harassment.

Violation can be reported, and we take all reports of misbehavior seriosuly, we will work to resolve the issue and take necessary disciplinary measures including but, no restricted, to banning a person from the team or the community. 

We strongly encourage everyone to be mindful of their interactions, actively promote inclusivity, and contribute to the overall well- being of the community!

## ** 3.Getting Started **

To start collaborating, first, fork the repository from GitHub, creating your own personal copy.  Afterwards, clone the repository using the `git clone <your-fork URL>` command in your terminal or command line. Make sure to update any local packages before you start work using `npm install`.

Next you will need create a dedicated branch for your specific contributions by using `git checkout -b <your-branch- name>` where the `<your Branch> name> `is a description that explains your goal for this branch. This keeps your work organized and separate.

Finally, make your changes, test them thoroughly, and commit to your new branch before creating the pull request. This keeps your local repository tidy, and provides a good workflow.

 ## ** 4.How to Contriibute **

 There is a lot of ways to help with the project. You could submit a bug fix, suggest a new idea and feature, update our documentation to make it more readable, write automated or unit tests, and many more things!

Before implementing a significant feature, we strongly encourage opening an issue and briefly outlining your idea and discussing potential implementation approaches to prevent duplicate effort or misdirection. Open communication is very important to keep a healthy workflow within the team.

We encourage contributions of all types, whether big or small and we are excited to see what you come up with. Please, don't hesitate to ask and reach out if you need help!

## ** 5.Reporting Bugs **

To report a bug, create a new issue on the GitHub repository with a clear and concise title describing the issue. Be very precise.

Provide detailed steps to reproduce the bug, including any relevant environment information, versions of dependencies, configurations, and error log snippets.  The more information, the better.

A clear, reproducible bug report helps us understand, diagnose, and resolve issues promptly.

## ** 6 .Suggesting Enhancements **

 To propose a new feature or an improvement, create a new issue on this GitHub repository. In the issue, describe the idea with enough details, explaining the motivation behind it, and the potential use cases. 

 We appreciate clear explanations, including how the new feature would be used, what problems it aims to solve to improve the user experience, and what benefits it would bring to our users or the project in general.

Our maintainers will review your suggestions for feasibility, alignment with our project goals, and prioritize them alongside the existing backlog. 

## ** 7 .Pull Request Process **

To submit a pull request, first, create a descriptive branch name, typically prefixed with a `feature/` or `fix/`, reflecting the changes being made, as `git checkout -b feature/amazing-thing- i-made `

Make changes within your created/branch. Be sure that your new commits conform to guidelines.  Once satisfied, run the tests (described further in a later section), before pushing changes from your local repository with:  `git push origin your-branch-name` and create the pull request from the Github UI using the created `your-branch-name`.

Maintainers will review and comment. Be responsive to these requests. Finally after approvals tests passed and other validations you can be expect your request merged and now a contributing code of the community.

## ** 8.Coding Standards **

 Our codebase follows specific styling conventions for clarity and consistency. Code should neatly be indentded.  All code needs descriptive names. Follow a naming style, for methods variables functions for consistency of all of them across different contributors and team developers.

Linters are also a required element; ensure all the automated testing and formatting tools (configured in `.eslintrc` or other configuration file ) pass and run on pre commit, and before merging to keep code standards clean! Code should contain documentation as comments in functions to describe the goal of each one, what is expected from the code or function. 

## ** 9.Testing Guidelines **

Running and contributing test should be easy.  Run all current test cases, use command like `npm test` from command prompt. Add test case that test any changes, improve test cases for corner or special scenarios of code or functions

Support frameworks, we recommend Jest for Unit testings. Add tests to your pull request and be very careful that they fail and pass correctly with you contribution code to confirm functionality. Unit and Integration Test cases, must always confirm functionality with expected behaviour and data

## ** 10.Documentation Contributions **

Improve and add the code by keeping a updated documentation to explain the functionality behind them, to make a easier experience and usage, as a reference, for all team contributors and new comers of code base . Documentation should explain purpose. It would explain all available function and methods available from that code section. 

Our document is written inside `/docs`. Update and submit those, as the changes described previously and by contributing a good documenation, all people could have better understand the code purpose and behaviour! 

## ** 11. Commit Message Guidelines **

We enforce conventional commits: Each commit must have title and short messages and follow specific guidelines!  Prefix your commit messages with an appropriate scope/type to indicate the purpose, use prefixes `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`. `ci`, for a clear commit explanation!

Commit title/body needs concise, describe what was implemented for a clear explanation of the contribution to future code maintenance! Keep in line and in a consistent message formatting!

## ** 12.Branching Model **

This project follows the Git Flow Branching Strategy for effective collaborative. Use a central master as the base, use development as integration branch, feature branching as new functionalities development

Always create your changes inside separate branch, and use branch name to indicate functionality and goal as: `feature/<my_cool_functionality_description>` ,  when creating feature and for fixes and other tasks use similar named convention! Avoid pushing directly into develop branch from your working copies.

## ** 13.Review Process **

Our process ensures contributions have high code standards! Once submitted to maintainers. We provide constructive feedback for the contribution in form of PR and review to enhance functionality of contribution or quality. We will check the new feature/bugfix with all of current code standards before approval of contribution, so please respond as requested and improve!

Pull request merges and approvals depend on quality code standards tests passed! Maintainer review code standards for potential bugs to make it stable

## ** 14.Communication Channels **

 Join the team discussion through this discord channels `[Link]` . You're also welcome to discuss with us and contribute via open github issue tracker `[Github-IssueLink]`. We value respectful discussion, constructive ideas and welcome you all, don't hesitant to communicate to reach team members to discuss your needs! 

Open to communication with each one. Don\'t hesitant and be respectful for team and other community!
  

## ** 15.Security and Responsible Disclosure **

 To protect security of team members. Any vulnerabilities, report privately, to a responsible member `security@[domain].com`. Provide full information on your report. Don\'t publicly post vulnerabilities to keep it in a private manner as possible and keep safe code, as much time and as quick.
We take any vulnerability with extreme responsibility and work to keep safe community as we possible and secure the code to keep secure the code

## **16.Release Process**
The version number are defined using SemVer. `[Release process]`, and it can increase version with patch bug/hotfix and new release of version and all changes are recorded and described into `CHangeLog` file in `ROOT_PROJECT/`. All new code are tested and corrected for release version
New Releases will happen after the approval by maintainers to improve code version for release
