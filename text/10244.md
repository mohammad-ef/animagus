# CONTRIBUTING#
  
Welcome to contributing to the project! We appreciate your willingness to help us improve it. This guide outlines our guidelines and provides resources to ensure a smooth and efficient contribution experience. 

Contributions, whether it be a minor documentation fix to new core features, help us to continually grow, innovate, and address community needs, ultimately strengthening the software.  We value contributions from everyone, and strive to create a supportive, open environment where diverse perspectives are valued and heard.

This guide is for everyone - those familiar with our codebase, and those making their first contributions to open source. Read it carefully before starting, to avoid frustration or wasted effort and help ensure your contribution can be easily merged in a time efficient manor. Your input is valuable. Let’s improve together! 

## Code of Conduct ##  
 
We strive to foster an inclusive, collaborative, and respectful environment here.  All contributors and participants are expected to act with consideration in their communication and interactions and to treat all others with dignity, kindness, and respect. 

Harassment, discrimination, or any form of disrespectful conduct directed towards any individual will result in consequences, up to and including a ban from participating in the project.  We are committed to maintaining a safe and welcoming space for everyone, regardless of background, experience, or skill level.

Our goal is to build a thriving community centered around shared passion for open-source software. If you experience an instance of behavior that violates this CoC, please contact [maintainer contact or reporting link]. All reports will be treated seriously and confidentially within legal boundaries.

## Getting Started ## 

To get started, you'll need to have [Programming Language, e. g., Python, Java, JavaScript or a specific tool, e. g., Node.js, Docker] and a version control system installed (Git). We use Git for version control.

First, fork the repository on GitHub. Then, clone your fork to your local machine.  You can do this using the command: `git clone <your_fork_url>`.  Replace `< your_fork_url >` with the HTTPS or SSH URL of your fork.

Navigate to the project directory within your local system's terminal and set it up. Run `npm install` to install any required packages if applicable, otherwise use whatever dependency package installer your system uses e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Before you begin working on a feature, create a new branch from the `main` branch using a descriptive name for your branch e.g `git checkout -b feature/new-button`. 

Now that your branch has been set up you should install dependencies with appropriate commands like: `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

You can start building or working in your development enviornment by utilizing a IDE that allows version control integration. It helps with branching management and merging into main or any new branches to maintain code quality.

Remember to always commit changes often using concise and understandable descriptions e.g `git commit -m "Added basic button styles"` or using a standardized approach such as "feat: added user login function".

## How to Contribute ##

There are several ways you can contribute to the project. Whether it relates to fixing errors, or proposing changes that will better align the project towards goals of scalability or efficiency; any help makes an impactful impact on overall quality.

If you discover a bug or unexpected behavior, report it as an issue on GitHub. If you find some areas of documentation could use improvement (clartiy or accuracy for users/maintainers), you're welcome to suggest a documentation pull request! If a particular aspect could use more thorough tests for edge-cases. All are very useful.

Feel free to suggest new features or improvements by opening up a feature request or engaging the discussion in issue #XXX . This can allow us as developers/ maintainers and potential users an understanding for why a change might need to occur to better align project to needs of wider audience or internal users.

Please, for bigger changes (like large new features or major refactorings), please first create an issue summarizing the intended change and open a conversation about it before diving deep into coding to help streamline process!

We value all contributions to the overall software quality so even the simplest improvements, or clarifications in existing processes can provide great help for maintainer/developers in future and current work!

## Reporting Bugs ##

When reporting a bug, provide a clear and concise description of the issue. Including the context and conditions of what occurred is crucial. Be specific about which version of the software you were using.

A minimal, reproducible example (MRE) is incredibly helpful. An MRE demonstrates the bug clearly with as little code as possible and helps with diagnosing it efficiently. 

Be sure to mention all the operating system(s) involved in experiencing issues, or if a particular configuration setting or software setup might induce this problem, so others with the same settings will better understand potential solutions to bugs.

Create a new issue on GitHub ([Link to the repository on GitHub]) with the bug report. Provide detailed steps to reproduce the problem so we may be able to fix this in the fastest method. 

## Suggesting Enhancements ##

To propose new features or enhancements, start by opening an issue on GitHub outlining the change that should be implemented and providing a good description of motivation, including how this improvement may help users of your application/project, etc. 

Describe how this proposed feature might look, the user use-cases and/or what benefit would occur in an effort for us as project managers/maintainers, developers or even users alike better grasp scope to change that could occur to the code!

We'll review all suggestions carefully and prioritize them based on feasibility, impact, and alignment with the project direction and goals for our roadmap! This helps keep the project up-to-date while ensuring that the codebase doesn;t deviate too greatly in terms of architecture

If the suggested change gets green-lit and is feasible; maintainers would create a plan for incorporating and may even ask that specific developers or maintainers collaborate. We want a well tested product, but are always seeking feedback.

## Pull Request Process ##

Before you start working on a major change, it might be helpful to submit an initial request, a preliminary request if it makes sense. It would let us as managers and project owners to get feedback about what's happening.

To work on your own changes and incorporate into this product's architecture, create a new branch with descriptive names e.g. `git checkout -b fix/issue-355`. Make sure it is descriptive of its context in what changes occur.

Write small, focused commits, each addressing a single, clear purpose or feature, using standardized naming practices and descriptions as mentioned below for more details to help maintainers review them quickly, as a streamlined flow is ideal when merging pull requests into main codebase!

Follow a clear and organized code style and add unit/integration testing. Make your contributions as easy as possible, so it would not hinder maintainers from being efficient while evaluating them as pull requests are evaluated on GitHub and are submitted!
   
Open a pull request on GitHub targeting the `main` branch or appropriate dev branches as designated, following standard guidelines of submitting and describing your intended purpose to merge! The review/merging is a great point and opportunity of knowledge for those new contributors

## Coding Standards ##

Adhering to consistent coding standards makes it easier to read, understand, and maintain the code base, improving developer quality overall while making maintenance efficient, and allowing us maintain a stable product in time

This project strives to use established and accepted coding patterns in programming for consistency. For our project this includes [Specific standard or framework such as PEP 8 (Python), Google Style Guide (Java)]. Details are also specified for [Linters, e.g., Flake8, ESLint; Type checkers, e.g., MyPy] used to automatically catch code style or quality related concerns as potential bugs are detected early during development, improving quality for the user base overall.

Documentation in comments within our source is very welcome but be descriptive with what is going on with each block as much detail possible as that can make understanding the purpose behind code that much clearer and helpful, and is encouraged when adding any code to a project as it improves future code review and development time

Ensure you have a good testing process and test suite, with passing builds that adhere with code and project standards and guidelines to allow for reviews from maintainer/contributors! It allows easier understanding of functionality, purpose as an easy-to-follow standard, so maintainable code base overall,

## Testing Guidelines ##

We encourage thorough testing and use a suite of automated checks, using [specific frameworks: e.g., Pytest, JUnit, Jest, etc] which are setup and automated during the deployment cycle, which allows a streamlined process for all.

We follow the testing pyramid model with emphasis placed upon [Testing style such as Unit Testing/ Integration Tests/ Acceptance tests], ensuring that each level of tests provides coverage. All tests can be easily found and are available for runner within codebase!

New feature implementations MUST include relevant test scenarios or cases. Regression and/or sanity check testing may even occur when introducing major/large changes as it allows to quickly identify if there have some adverse side effects

If your code does not compile with testing and passes, the maintainer may request for a test or test update if not included as part of your initial pull requests. All new and updated changes, will need tests that adhere to guidelines as mentioned previously

## Documentation Contributions ##

Well-written documentation is an integral aspect and key part of this projects usability, as one way it allows ease and comfort when understanding products or services being offered

Our primary documentation sources live within our `/docs` directory (or specified other folder/area of codebase if not the former.) We strive for a standard documentation format and are using the style and guidelines of  [Markdown/ReadTheDocs] for consistent readability

Before making any change, ensure to familiarize yourself, with how we currently format documents or other aspects related. Clear instructions and concise explanation for ease in understanding the overall goal or intent of code.
 

## Commit Message Guidelines ##

Write concise, but descriptive messages so all developers have clarity regarding nature of commits, especially important when merging code in a large scale codebase.

Following standardized format helps maintain readability when examining git commits or looking up logs, especially useful and simplifies the work during the maintenance/updates phases and overall product development and lifecycle, which ensures quality! 

Conventional commits provide a structure like 'feat:', 'fix', 'docs', 'refactor' etc to describe the nature and type changes made to overall product, as a structured process helps improve clarity, consistency across commits! We use semantic meaning when creating these commits! 

## Branching Model ##

We're currently following the [Branch Model name - e.g., Gitflow, trunk-based] for managing feature and releases, with specific guidance to allow developers/collaborators understand what branching ideas or strategies may align better

`main` or `master` always holds our deployable and released versions and codebase that has already gone through review. We will always make sure all features have tests, quality control processes, and reviews, prior integration, before integrating! 

Feature or Bugfixes can then originate off our develop and can later merged, when complete with appropriate review! All contributors and stakeholders must understand branching practices, prior integration and testing as it will prevent integration problems and maintain codebase!

## Review Process ##

Once a Pull Request (PR) is opened, the core team will conduct thorough and quality assessments to assess if any potential errors or quality related improvements can arise, and make any necessary comments/improvements before being merge into `main`!
 
Feedback is intended to make our project the highest it can reach; Provide helpful feedback.  If feedback differs greatly than intentions, open and transparent and constructive dialogues, is the recommended best approach

All approved contributions will get tested before merged, with quality assurances. We'll follow established quality processes and methodologies before any integrations. Once the review phase complete all tests and quality controls have passed and merge occurs into respective branch, we thank and thank you all contributors

## Communication Channels ##

The best way to stay engaged is via a dedicated [Platform or service for communications]. Feel free to ask any relevant, specific, or quality control oriented discussions!
   
If an issue arises where the best method may to engage on the topic of code is slow/difficult to engage; you may open up an impromptu chat via our designated service [Chat/messaging service such as Discord or Slack etc] 
   
Please respect others opinions when communicating, regardless whether technical skill sets vary and all participants should feel free and confident about engaging discussions! We aim towards building positive and collaborative communication channels and environment, and embrace the differences within!

## Security and Responsible Disclosure ##

To help our software maintain its reliability as we all strive to reach a standard where all aspects of security, stability, etc is met: we take it quite seriously!
   
Security-related bug findings are critical; Do not publicly announce vulnerabilities before giving a period and timeframe for fixes, with responsible timeframe of a certain duration before public notification of such concerns, to avoid possible abuse of the product or software itself
  
Direct contact and messaging is highly suggested; You can do so by using contact email and reporting process via our website and/or Github [security/report@domain]. It keeps us all aware! All communications remain completely secure as they all get assessed in-depth to help improve security!
  
## Release Process ##
   
Release processes and cadence occur at intervals determined, as project team considers all needs based upon quality checks of product
   
All version updates/patches will adhere semantic and follow standardized versions to maintain transparency and consistency to all end users; Major and/or breaking change versions can occur based and as determined through roadmap definitions
   
After each code update or new functionality has successfully been verified, it'll go to tag release.  After tags we increment release number accordingly and deploy to all target production environment!
   
## Recognition ##

Our community and its individual contributor(s) all contribute in a unique and impactful nature as each individual brings new skillsets!  
   
Our website/ Github profile all list individual(s) involved as contributors, and are listed for contributions as part overall project recognition. A public and open thank is all you need and that we will be happy to acknowledge and give to everyone!
