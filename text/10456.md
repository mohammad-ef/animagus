# PyStock - A Simplified Stock Prediction Tool with Machine Learning

## Description

PyStock provides streamlined stock price forecasting leveraging historical data and machine learning. It is designed for users who want quick access to predictions without extensive data preparation or complex model training workflows and offers a simplified way to explore potential market moves. The system takes daily stock price data, performs feature engineering (e g. moving averages), applies a trained regression model like Linear Regression, and delivers future stock price estimates.

This tool's key advantage lies in its user-friendly interface and minimal configuration. It avoids the complexity of deep learning networks in favor of readily explainable and efficient regression techniques. Py Stock allows users to quickly analyze a specific stock's potential performance based on historical trends.  It' is a practical solution for beginners exploring stock market analysis and quick, basic predictive modelling.

Under the hood, PyStock primarily utilizes Python's libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and NumPy for numerical computation. This modular design enables easier extension of models to explore time series models in future development.  A clear focus on reproducibility leads to consistent and reliable forecasting, given that all configurations are defined using standard parameters within an included `config.yaml` file.

We prioritize a small resource footprint to enable operation on low-resource systems or even in a browser. A command-line interface allows flexible use within existing financial applications. Our modular framework allows extension using more robust models, should higher prediction accuracies prove required, although this introduces a degree of computational overhead.

PyStock serves a unique need: the intersection of accessibility and practical prediction. By removing layers of unnecessarry technical complexities and prioritizing ease-of-use for a quick prediction of stocks with simple, easy-to-explain regressions.

## Installation Instructions

Before beginning, make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system. Python's Package Manager, pip, will also be needed. You may need to use a virtual environment manager like 'venv' or 'conda' to isolate project dependencies from your global environment.  These managers allow projects to have isolated Python installations that are distinct from the system environment and can reduce package collisions between applications.

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/pystock.git
```
Then navigate to the project directory. Using a shell prompt such as Command Prompt, Power Shell, Bash or Z Shell:
```bash
cd pystock
```

Create a virtual environment if you donot have one. This helps maintain your project dependencies.
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```
Now, activate the environment for Windows using Powershell. For Bash-style shells like zsh or bash on macOS, or on other Unix systems you should do a variation.
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
Or use:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies using pip. These packages contain functions for stock market analysis. This step installs required python modules to run pystock successfully:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Verify the package versions. You should see something akin to what appears on the file requirements.txt that lists all installed and used package.

On macOS, the command may return with warnings concerning security-policy or missing certificates; resolve the problem either temporarily bypassing security, installing necessary system updates. For Debian or Ubuntu-based distributions the system must also be able to use apt, so it may request the addition of additional repository entries in some situations.

If installing on Windows using an environment where Python isn`t added as part of system `PATH`, you may want to explicitly invoke Pip.exe from `[path to your project] .venv \ scripts` rather than simply invoking Pip on your machine, since the environment will take precedence. Windows users often encounter permission denied or security errors with installation and should be sure that user account privileges have write permission access in their target location to the directory that `pip` is trying to write into.

## Usage Instructions

After installation, the project will require some initial setup and running before usage can take place. This initial run includes model download which will allow it to work effectively when called. The tool provides two core methods to make stock price prediction; running through Command Line, or running the program in Jupyter Notebook using an interactive shell interface.

To make a prediction via the command line interface (CLI), run the main script using `pystock.py`:
```bash
python pystock.py --ticker <STOCK_SYMBOL> --days <FORECAST_DAYS>
```
Replace `<STOCK_SYMBOL>` with the ticker symbol of the stock you want to predict (e.g., AAPL, MSFT) and `<FORECAST_DAYS>` with the number of days into the future you want to forecast.

Example using the Microsoft (MSFT) stock:
```bash
python pystock.py --ticker MSFT --days 30
```

The above CLI command requests the application predict for MSFT 30 days in the future. A simple textual prediction output containing forecasted closing prices per each specified prediction will show as result on standard output. For instance the output can appear something such as '255.05 for Day 1,' which means for Day 1 the prediction is 255.05 USD closing rate for Microsoft's Stock.

Using a Jupyter notebook involves launching it and then running the main cell within the notebook template (usually `main.ipynb`) and calling it.
Ensure all the required data, such as ticker name, days-out are defined. This will execute the analysis automatically, printing predictions directly on screen within the environment, with interactive visualization and custom model parameter tweaking also enabled by the interface. This approach gives the greatest ease of debugging or exploring other prediction configurations or models without restarting a terminal or environment to run again and is preferred to use in development scenarios or rapid testing iterations..

PyStock provides additional advanced capabilities using flags and configuration variables; you can configure historical days considered or update the algorithm being implemented through editing the main `config.yaml` to specify your parameters of preference for your custom needs to be applied in each forecast.. It also supports batch processing, by iterating across several tickers and saving predictions. For that the `bulk_predictions.py` file provides all the parameters that should be used when invoking from a script run and should contain your ticker and number of future days required per symbol.

## Configuration

The core behavior of PyStock is managed through the `config.yaml` file located in the project repository at the same path from wherever `pystock.py` and related resources reside. The configuration dictates key behaviors of the project; this includes the algorithm selected (Linear Regression as a baseline implementation is default and available, as is potential to implement other models such as Exponential Moving Averages for comparison or use with different data inputs), as well as input file paths and number of prediction points for which to output predictions for each forecast iteration

To alter model configuration such as hyper-parameter tuning values of regression algorithms you may alter entries inside this .yaml file. The 'ticker' section of this configuration determines data download locations of specific ticker symbol's history to load and perform analyses; you can update these as well. This file enables customization of forecasting parameters or data paths and ensures all the necessary components have consistent parameters across execution calls

Furthermore the configuration contains settings pertaining data cleaning parameters (e.g.: removal or correction outliers), which affect how training is handled when models attempt making stock projections and the data used within these algorithms and models for stock prediction purposes . It can be modified by a developer. You might adjust how feature-scaling methods such scaling by Z-scores affect performance for certain models as an additional configuration variable.. Environment variables like 'STOCK_API_KEY' might override values defined inside the config and allows external configurations, providing a convenient method in deployments where configuration values can`t easily stored on a system.. It`s a very important tool for managing how the system interacts during each step

## Project Structure

The PyStock repository is organized into a structured folder layout designed for clarity and extensibility. The root level has core script `pystock.py` and the `main.ipynb` file, which acts a main driver entrypoints and the initial interactive exploration tool of functionality available and can quickly show results on a single machine with limited setup steps. `data/` and the folder is used store datasets or any temporary output data that are not meant to go into production but are generated and stored to aid in local development..
Here`s a simplified view of how your folders should structure within project's base location

```
pystock/
.
   |-- config.yaml       # Configuration file for parameters and paths
   |-- pystock.py         # Main prediction script. The execution starting entry
   |-- bulk_predictions.py #Script used when you must run model against bulk tickers, for batch processes and automated forecasts across a series
   |-- requirements.txt  # Dependency list and version specification file for installing python requirements via pip package management system.
   |-- main.ipynb # jupyter example notebook for running a sample forecast using the tool, for easy and quick setup.
   |-- README.md      # This README file you just reviewed
   |-- .venv # This may or may not appear; it`s an autogenerated file when Python executed a project using `venv`.  If you are using `conda` or some alternative method, a slightly distinct project may appear in it`.

```
`src/` (or other folders in similar vein such a `model_lib`, may be utilized as a component-level folder that holds reusable model building modules.) The tests module, contains a range automated regression or testing routines which tests for model and algorithm integrity.
Finally configs holds custom config and configuration files.  The `docs/` module could be implemented in more comprehensive projects and holds copy, API references documentation for a comprehensive description that may require an external build step to output to static html or a similar file output for web delivery.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance PyStock. If you encounter any bugs, submit a clear issue report. For proposed enhancements or fixes, use a pull request (PR) approach following standard Git practices

Ensure code changes conform with coding guidelines which is to write modular python modules with doc strings describing parameters as they apply in model calls for each algorithm implementation and to maintain consistency in indentation and variable name usage to improve the overall codebase readabilty; unit testing is expected on code and modules before pull request.

PR reviews focus on maintainability code correctness with an attempt by peer reviewing for overall project standards of the codebase; a well commented code helps greatly for a reviewer. PR must be merged after the reviewers give approval and code must also conform. If tests don\'t meet passing criteria they are also blocked for merge, but are welcome if the developer adds or changes a testing procedure as well.
For new contributions please create an appropriate feature-branch from development or mainline and include descriptive branch commit notes for easy tracing in the git project repository

## Acknowledgments

We gratefully acknowledge the Scikit-learn project for its efficient and accessible machine learning algorithms. Also appreciate support to libraries Pandas & NumPy which have streamlined operations within our analysis pipelines which have been fundamental to this work as core data-oriented modules within. Thanks go out too, toward contributors in online stock analysis, for inspiring the creation this simplified predictive analysis tool. Lastly a thanks go out towards the contributors that helped develop and support python as language and community

## System Architecture

PyStock follows a modular architecture built primarily with python, facilitating ease to modify the underlying code to extend functionality and enhance its core capabilities with greater depth than a typical application might possess. A key design principle involves isolating data-processing steps from prediction models to ease future enhancements in algorithms as they arrive and are evaluated in production scenarios..  A configuration that allows the user a high level flexibility when choosing particular stock tickers, prediction points into future and model parameters is essential as an architecture design component, so flexibility remains readily available and is easy accessable when the project needs adjustment or adaptation to new situations

Here the major system design modules

1.  Data Loading/Fetching Module (Utilizes downloaded data via Yahoo or any API endpoint as a starting stage, and parses the input as a pandas Dataframe.)
2.  Feature Engineering Module(Derives technical signals, like Moving Averages to provide more meaningful context from original price history for machine learning to use for stock analysis and predictions, such as short/medium period MA.)
3.  Machine Regression Model Component : (The trained linear model or another regression type that uses engineered input for predicting closing market values).  The models will have a training file and be easily swapable or extendable to support more models
4.   API Interface Component -  The user command and interactive jupyter-implemented interfaces.  Allows to specify the inputs, parameters (days into the future to forecast) as part the model invocation, while also returning formatted/clean output as result in terminal/console.  These modules can then feed into the prediction pipeline for processing

Each modules operate through standard pipelines with data transformations being chained as necessary and can run independently to provide an architecture for scalability when future requirements emerge to handle greater amounts data in parallel

## API Reference

PyStock offers simple Command Line API leveraging arguments passed via shell, enabling quick forecast runs on the user's machine

`python pystock.py --ticker <STOCK_SYMBOL> --days <FORECAST_DAYS>`

Where
 `<STOCK_SYMBOL>` refers a stock trading under its ticker abbreviation on financial market; Microsoft ticker, MSFT as example;

<FORECAST_DAYS> signifies days for predictions, with minimum is equal and above of value `1` to a very high numerical quantity; this will define number forecasts delivered per stock.

Currently only these two are supported, though additional options such custom training parameters might extend into additional flags and configurations later, though will follow similar argument pattern to enable seamless operation from CLI interface. The interactive shell API within a `main.ipynb` offers greater control by accessing the functions in `pystock.py`

## Testing

Testing forms crucial parts development lifecycle with Pystock; to enable a high reliability we provide extensive unit as part integration automated test cases to validate core algorithms for accurate performance predictions, while ensuring module interfaces function without any errors and maintain code base stability through constant changes and additions as needed, so automated regression runs occur after all code and model changes have merged or updated in development environment and run with `pytest --collect-only .` for an exhaustive report. The framework includes a comprehensive test environment to test various input parameters against different models. The integration testing will run end-to-end testing routines on an existing dataset.  For local setup `pytest` module distributes the execution environment, enabling automated unit/system regression testing for each component in pystock, to verify correctness, reliability for each algorithm

## Troubleshooting

Common Issues with Pystock: Dependency issues (packages that are outdated), can occur when dependencies fail resolve the package versions, partially because conflicting package dependencies, by resolving using latest version or by updating python package management tool; if data source unavailable (API failures): API key errors are a very common problem as the user forgets API, or incorrect configuration, so make to check API values are configured appropriately

Another typical problems is when data is corrupted; check source dataset files (such a .csv) and correct data for corrupted entries in stock quote data before running prediction algorithms on corrupted inputs or missing fields

Runtime issues due incorrect arguments: doublecheck parameters entered match those the system can parse (check the data types), for the input variables passed when using `pystock.py`; if still issues use verbose invocation with flag `--debug=1`, for enhanced output, or logging for more insights during troubleshooting; finally if problems aren''t solved review project's GitHub repo or open up new GitHub bug/request, and add relevant system setup/OS version information in report, along details for reproduction so that the issue is easier resolved, and other similar scenarios avoid

## Performance and Optimization

The project aims for quick prediction and uses a simple machine learning regression approach instead of deeper or advanced routines in model implementations. Data preprocessing and efficient data access through use libraries as Numpy are essential. The project avoids complex architecture that increases overhead; instead allow it keep simple by design, and avoid excessive RAM requirements or running processes for large calculations, by leveraging simple and targeted data structures that limit space complexity when working through historical values..

Consider caching downloaded or parsed source information, so to limit redundant operations. Profiling of algorithms can identify and address slow points within code for future improvements to overall performance

## Security Considerations

The API key to external API endpoints for accessing live-stock quotes and historical price must remain secret; avoid adding these API keys inside version controls and instead manage through the `STOCK_API_KEY` configuration setting. Validate the data coming and inputs to models, for unexpected behavior or data breaches

When developing new components in this architecture ensure inputs have validation to guard again against potential exploits by malicious entities to ensure system safety and integrity of all processes

## Roadmap

- Add advanced model support like ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing (ES).  We intend expanding to incorporate additional prediction methodologies.
- Implement visualization support, to display historical price movements in interactive plots along with future forecasts; This would improve data insight for end users of pystock
- Enhance error and data exception-handling for robust predictions; we would want all the predictions that come back to handle any errors, such edge-cases that are currently undefined and prevent model training failures from causing system failures..
- Provide API integration to allow seamless model predictions for existing stock applications
- Support alternative API data provider endpoints beyond existing default. Enhance modular design and configuration settings and provide flexibility of different market APIs in project workflow, which could increase overall adaptability and ease in different regions of world,

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

- Why Linear Regression model? We used simpler, well established algorithm because we had a priority of easy to use environment over high predictive performance and accuracy as our primary aim to provide a simple solution
- Does support historical prices beyond last decade?: Currently yes but data-fetching is throttled. It's not ideal if need a longer-time historical view
- Is support other exchanges, such than those in Asian or EU countries?: It can in principal with modifications in code
- Should API access for other sources like Yahoo Finance/IEXCloud be permitted?: It's currently not supported in core, we will implement
