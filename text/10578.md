# CONTRIBUTING TO MyCool Project!

Welcome! The maintain team sincerely welcomes and invites you to participate as a new collaborator and contributor in this amazing community. Your insights are vital to helping us maintain, evolve this software to best meet users expectations in the long term. Together and open communication, and continuous improvements are the foundation on which this projects thrives and grows with our users.

We are committed to fostering inclusivity and ensuring contributions come from a diverse base of users from across industries. Your skills, knowledge, and passion is welcomed with open arms to shape what comes next and help build something great. 

Contributing can take many forms. Whether fixing a minor bug, proposing a large-scale enhancement, updating documentation, or just promoting our open and welcoming culture - all forms of contribution are welcomed. Every single bit helps, no amount is too small! We are all learning together.

 ## 1. Code of Conduct 

We are committed to a welcoming atmosphere for both new and veteran developers! We ask all participants to maintain a professional and respectful communication style and be respectful in all interactions. We value open discussions, and encourage everyone' contributions and feedback.

Disrespect of others, discrimination, intimidation or any actions which compromise safety and/or inclusion of a person or group of people are **explicitly not permitted**. We are all here to contribute, and we want everyone to feel empowered and safe in expressing opinions, ideas, asking questions and/or challenging each other respectfully. 

If you experience any form of harassment or exclusionary behavior and wish to report it privately to a member of staff or an administrator, you are encouraged to do so. Our community is one with a zero tolerance approach to these issues. The consequences will vary, based on the severity and nature of the behavior exhibited.  

 ## 2. Getting Started

Before starting contribute, make sure you have Git installed on your machine. If you don't have any idea where to start you can download and follow install instructions from the [Git official homepage website](https://git-scm.com/) and follow their guide. This is required since the repository is hosted and tracked with a version control tool. 

The best way to start with the local setup is with:

 ```git
   git clone <git URL>
  ```
   
This command is essential, because it will download the entire code base of all the branches and files, so you can begin making modifications. You can find the Git repository's URL on the project's homepage, or on the GitHub page.
   
You will likely want to use an IDE with lint and code style tools to keep your code aligned with the coding guidelines. This tool will also help you catch common programming errors or stylistic issues. VS Code, Pycharm etc.

Once you downloaded the code base, you can navigate to the repository using your system's terminal. If you have installed a suitable build tool you can execute a 'make' or other install commands. This should set it up and make it ready with dependencies. 

To create a new work space and contribute you need to first make sure you' are on your personal or work branch. Create a new branch using: ```git checkouth -b <my new branch name>```. 

  
   
 ## 3. How to Contribute
 
We appreciate any help in improving project! Contributions are welcomed in a few ways, and we are grateful for your help. Whether you' are a seasoned contributor or have just joined the project, you have important insights and experience you can bring to help the development of the project.

You can help by reporting issues you discover, or by suggesting new feature ideas to expand the project capabilities. You are welcome to submit pull requests for any fixes you think can be beneficial. Also, if your a strong writer or have a knack for making code clear you can also contribute by editing and improving our documentation.

Before making a large-scale change, consider discussing the changes beforehand. Create a new discussion thread and outline the approach and rationale. The team can review the approach and offer insights.

4. **Reporting Bugs 

If something does not behave how it should or if you are encountering an error you did not expect, it will benefit the entire user group if reported! The best way to get help is to clearly describe your situation in a new issue on the [project GitHub repository issues](https://github.com/<user>/<repository>/issues). 

A good bug report should describe the issue concisely and be able to be reproduced by an independent reviewer or another team members. This helps the team reproduce and fix your bug quickly.

When creating new bugs, make sure you are providing all relevant information: the system environment, software configuration, steps for reproduction. This helps the maintain to isolate the issue as well. Also, please make sure a duplicate bug is not reported already before you open the issue on GitHub.

## 5 Suggesting Enhancements

We want to hear all your ideas for making the projects better and expanding on its functionality. If you have a great idea for improving the software, please feel free to contribute! The first step would be creating a new discussion thread on [project GitHub repository issues]( https://github.com/<user>/<repository>/issues).

Be as specific in describing what you' re trying to achieve with the suggested functionality. Describe how it would impact the user, which problem it' solves or how you think users would benefit. 

 The maintain can prioritize suggestions based on feasibility, effort, alignment with overall project goals. You will receive feedback or updates on the progression of the idea and it's implementation status as it moves forward.

   ## 6. Pull Request Process
   
If you are ready to contribute, the pull requesting process is simple. Make sure the working copy is up- to- date by executing the following: ```git pull origin <your branch- name>```. Create new branch based on the main branch and make all necessary changes.

When creating a new branch it is best practice to follow a specific standard. This makes it easily recognizable and understandable when you create a new branch. It is common that branches follow these standards: `feat/<branch name>`, ` fix/<branch name>`. 

Before creating a new branch you should make sure it is based on the most recent version of the branch to reduce the potential of conflicts. After you created the branch and pushed all code and files you can proceed to create the PR on GitHub.

Once your pull requests are created, it is automatically reviewed and tested by the build process on CI. If everything looks ok you will receive an approval from a senior developer and a merge request.

  ## 7. Coding Standards 

To maintain a consistent code- base the project follows specific style guidelines. Follow PEP8 when writing Python code. This includes indentation with 4 spaces, maximum line width of 79 characters. 

Linting tool such as `flake8` are integrated into our continuous integration process to automatically identify and flag code style violations and potential errors. This ensures code readability to maintain consistency.

Code should be thoroughly documented and all code elements such as functions, classes, or module have descriptive comments. This is vital to understand the code' s functionality. 

   
  ## 8. Testing Guidelines
  
All contribution should be accompanied by comprehensive tests. Tests are essential to ensure that the new code functions correctly and does not introduce any unforeseen problems. We use the `unittest` framework to run unit, integration, and regression tests. 

Ensure that all new and modified code is thoroughly tested. Write unit tests for individual functions and classes. Integration tests verify interactions between different components of the system, and regression tests ensure that existing functionality has not been negatively impacted after modifications. 

   
   ## 9. Documentation Contributions
   
Well-written and up to- date documentation is an essential asset to any software project. Help us improving documentation by updating or adding new pages and descriptions.  
   
Documentation files are typically stored within the `/doc ` directory. Use the same writing style across all parts of the documentation and use markdown language when contributing. Make sure the documentation is clear, concise, and easily understood and maintainable.

     ## 10. Commit Message Guidelines
   
When committing changes it is vital that commit messages follow a specific and consistent style. A standard helps the team understand the purpose of each changes, making it easier to review code and understand code evolution.
 
Use conventional commit format which is: `type(scope): description`. Common examples:  `feat: add new user feature`, ` fix: resolve a security bug`, `docs: update documentation`. The scope helps to identify the affected area.

Commit messages should be short and describe the nature of the changes. The commit message should clearly explain * why * the changes were made. 

    ## 11. Branching Model
   
Our project follows a trunk-based model, which encourages frequent integration and minimizes merge conflicts. New features are always branched from the ` main ` branch and merged back into it as soon as they are ready for release.

The ` develop ` branch is typically used for ongoing development and integration. It should be regularly merged with the ` main ` branches. It is best not to branch from the `develop ` branch, to avoid potential problems. 

  ## 12. Review Process

Pull request reviews are essential to maintain high-quality code and ensure all changes align with project goals and standards. Reviews will be conducted by maintainers and senior developers. 
   
The reviewers will check if code style guidelines are followed, the logic is sound and test cases properly test the implemented changes. Provide timely and constructive feedback when reviewing PR and be responsive to feedback.
   
  The PR will be merged into ` main ` once the tests pass.  

   ## 13. Communication Channels
  
For general discussions and questions, use the [project GitHub issues](https://github.com/<user>/<repository>/issues). For more urgent matters you should reach to the maintain directly through GitHub or by sending an email.

We encourage open and respectful communication. 
   
    ## 14 Security and Responsible Disclosure
   
If you find a security vulnerability, please do not public disclose it.  Contact the security team via [project email address] as soon as possible and we will investigate the issue. 
   
We are committed to addressing security issues promptly. Please follow the instructions and guidelines for responsible reporting.

     ## 15 Release Process

New releases will be prepared by maintainers based on the accumulated changes in the ` main ` branches. The release process includes tagging the commit that introduces the new version, updating the changelog file. 

   
Semantic versioning `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` will be adopted. This will allow users to understand the changes introduced with each release.

     ## 16 Recognition
 We want to recognize the important work of our contributors. All contributors will be acknowledged in the project's documentation and on the GitHub contributors page.

   
 We appreciate your efforts in making our project better and we are looking forward to your help with improving the software.
