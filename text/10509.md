# PyStock - A Simplified Stock Market Analyzer

A Python application that analyzes stock data, calculates fundamental indicators and generates basic investment recommendations, aimed towards beginner- and intermediate-level finance enthusiasts.  It simplifies the overwhelming amount of financial data into a readable and understandable form and helps identify potentially profitable investing opportunities. The project's goal is education and accessibility, not professional trading advice.

## System Architecture

Py Stock uses a modular design, splitting responsibilities across three key components: data acquisition, analysis and reporting. First, a data scraping module gathers historical stock prices.  Next, an indicator calculation module computes technical & fundamental data, and finally, a reporting module produces visualizations and simple investment ideas based off the analysis. 

The application relies heavily on the `yfinance` library for stock data, `pandas` and  `numpy` for data manipulation and calculations, and `matplotlib` for charting. This modular structure allows easier debugging, maintenance, and extensibility of functionality as required.  The project also makes strategic decisions for optimization, prioritizing efficiency within reasonable time limits of data access for ease of development.

PyStock employs an event-driven pattern to manage interactions within components; when certain indicators surpass set boundaries, new analysis reports trigger. Error handling is central and utilizes `try...except` to ensure program functionality in scenarios where stock or network information are not fully provided. The program architecture ensures the user receives informative reports with minimal disruptions in workflow.

Data is stored as .csv files and processed in a dataframe object for calculations which allows the user a clear and transparent process with which their calculations are made.  We prioritize clear and efficient code and have included a detailed breakdown for ease of debugging if required, facilitating enhanced adaptability to the changing landscape of the investing market. Future enhancements can expand its data scope to cover international equities and cryptocurrency to meet broader investment research demand.

Data from multiple stock markets may eventually become the foundation for future versions, therefore the modular framework allows us the option to incorporate, process and report data efficiently across markets when required, enhancing overall project scope for more comprehensive data reporting. The application is optimized with minimal library and memory usage for stability and reliability when working in different machine hardware capabilities.




## Installation Instructions

Before installation, make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Verify that you also have `pip`, the Python package installer, installed alongside Python. Running `python --version` in your terminal confirms successful Python installation, while `pip --version` validates your `pip` installation.

Create a new project directory: `mkdir PyStock` followed by navigation inside this newly created directory with `cd PyStock`. Next, initialize a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`. Using virtual environments allows the management of isolated package sets which are independent libraries for this and potentially future Python project use cases. Activate your newly formed virtual environment by either `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).

Now, install the necessary dependencies: `pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib`. This will install all external packages required by PyStock from the Python Package Index. `yfinance` facilitates the collection of financial information for stocks and indexes, pandas allows the handling and structuring of information in tabular formats and NumPy supports calculations for statistical modeling within financial markets.

The yfinance installation process is simple. However, in rare cases on some environments, errors might be seen related with certificates or proxies and should be reviewed with internet provider if persistent issues remain in resolving the package import issue. The project includes an automated process to detect the environment setup, if a failure arises. This should resolve some issues that arise when the internet or system certificates require further updates to support package import.

After all of these installations have taken place you should now confirm everything works without problems before continuing to setup. To check all packages were successfully added type `pip list` inside the console which would allow a rapid list display for the relevant software libraries.  A list with each software name alongside version and the installation date would confirm the success and proper setup.

For Linux or macOS users with issues importing modules or dependencies ensure all required tools, for example GCC are present or have been properly updated within their OS and terminal configurations, and retry again the install. The Windows version is designed for simplicity so minimal changes may need resolving. 

Once you have correctly completed steps to this stage and verified everything runs correctly move to setting the initial setup for this system before proceeding to next stages for usage of PyStock. 




## Usage Instructions

To use PyStock, first ensure the project is within an activated virtual environment. Then, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script `pystock.py` is located. Run the main script with `python pystock.py` and then you'll see a welcome screen displaying information on using it for investment data research.

The `pystock.py` script offers command-line arguments. To see options run `python pystock.py --help` for details regarding the script, arguments and parameters. This is helpful in learning which information needs providing to receive the correct and targeted information to aid investment data research needs. The basic usage of a specific stock analysis command would use, e.g. `python pystock.py --ticker MSFT`. 

You can input specific data points to analyze by utilizing additional parameters.  These may contain data periods and additional metrics that can further assist in understanding trends or investment potential with different metrics such as price volatility over a longer period to see if the trend will remain. You should see a detailed summary and graphical chart once it has successfully finished analysis to view and evaluate for potential investment strategies.

For performing an analysis, you may specify several arguments like --period and --indicators for more customized reporting of analysis data to aid the research in financial modeling needs and decision-making strategies to help improve outcomes over various conditions of trading environments found.

If encountering error or incorrect information verify that your system requirements, dependencies are satisfied, including that yfinance and related dependencies were installed successfully within the same python runtime used. Check ticker symbols entered for errors, or verify capitalization for accuracy in results displayed. Incorrect or unsupported information will display accordingly within reporting screens for analysis.

Beyond single analysis the tool offers the potential to run in a background loop, monitoring specific data over set periods or intervals of the data being scraped with automatic reports to provide constant information for analysis of trading conditions to aid informed decisions to mitigate losses or maximize potential earnings over long term horizons.




## Configuration

The main configuration options reside within the `config.yaml` file located in the root of the project. The YAML file dictates data sources and thresholds for calculations and visualizations within reports. Open this with a standard YAML editing text software, such as notepad or similar text software available with most computer hardware systems to change data source files. 

You can customize the `ticker_list` section in `config.yaml` by editing or appending additional stock tickers which allows the script to perform automatic scans. Ensure correct ticker syntax aligning closely with those found within yahoo financial or data sources used in `yfinance` as any syntax mismatch causes errors to display and stop functionality within the analysis and calculation routines of `pystock`.   You must follow specific rules for the data structure, ensuring data is in the required format and structure. 

Environment variables can further refine application settings for enhanced flexibility within varied system and data environment setups. You can modify variables through a `.env` file placed within the project and then run this file within your terminal or through your command-line environment to activate variables that may be specific settings tied to certain machine requirements to optimize system configurations with different machine architectures.   This enables you to adjust data storage paths and other settings without altering your core codebase for enhanced adaptability when dealing with data management and security settings on the project system.

Threshold parameters like those controlling investment buy signals in a separate settings block can modify the sensitivity for identifying trading decisions to reflect different investing strategies from aggressive options that focus on fast profit potential or passive investments with long terms growth goals over decades with more conservative investment approaches with more gradual profits and returns for investment strategies.   Settings and data can all be easily adjusted with these tools allowing a dynamic investment data system with adaptability across trading environments.

Considerations of memory, bandwidth, system processing speeds can all factor in to performance optimization of settings. For slower processing or bandwidth constraints adjust reporting periods with less granularity and consider running analysis offline during low periods or off hours.

## System Architecture

PyStock uses a tiered system that separates responsibilities for better efficiency and organization. Data Collection is first step in gathering stock information which occurs by interacting through yfinance to download and structure information to facilitate reporting of the data across various periods. The Data Calculation Layer involves processing and structuring collected stock and market values and computing fundamental analysis. This layer uses libraries from Python like Pandas, which supports complex calculations in an easy framework and generating investment reports to visualize data through charting.

These different process layers enhance scalability, with clear module divisions enabling independent scaling across each level as demands and load requirements evolve in response across data volumes with increased user loads or expanded reporting parameters of analysis, providing the platform flexibility.   

Error Management and Exception is integrated to provide robust performance, catching data and environment-related errors to minimize program crashes or loss.  Reporting is handled with the graphical user representation that facilitates easy-to-interpret insights and analysis from stock information.

Dependencies on yfinance library allows for quick retrieval for historical information for financial assets and markets which helps to reduce processing latency when data updates are needed and the ability to efficiently analyze stock data and perform fundamental calculations in efficient data-structures like pandas allows efficient processing of larger dataset, and enhances scalability across all tiers to meet market research data analysis demand requirements and improve reporting and analysis accuracy with dynamic changes in trading models for users




## API Reference

PyStock provides an extensive CLI based on parameters, with various data parameters accessible via a CLI to provide users an accessible API without coding skills necessary:

*   **`--ticker <SYMBOL>`**: (Required)  Stock symbol (e.g., MSFT, AAPL)
*   **`--period <DAYS>`**: Duration in days of history required
*   **`--indicators <LIST>`**: List of technical indicators for the data to analyze (optional) Example `ema_50,rsi_14`
*   **`--threshold <VALUE>`**: Investment buy/sell criteria for data reporting (Optional) Example `0.01`. This will be applied on calculated values from stock reports, such as EMA to RSI.

To call for information the syntax should include the parameter and values needed with `python pystock.py --ticker AAPL --period 60 --indicators ema_50,rsi_14 --threshold 0.01` to gain insights for data reports, providing the ability to filter results to suit needs of user with minimal setup, with a flexible design framework and minimal code to provide the best user friendly investment research reporting for various user groups

The system supports data processing in parallel and is built modular which provides efficient API performance regardless data loads to provide rapid feedback when generating investment research for users for trading and market investment research purposes

Data processing API facilitates automated analysis for multiple asset reports by scheduling batch processing for various stock reports, allowing the system automated generation of market investment insights, enhancing user capabilities and research capabilities and facilitating faster analysis and investment reporting.   




## Testing

Testing for PyStock focuses primarily on functional tests using the standard library of testing modules. To initialize this process you should execute:  `pytest` from within `tests` to run automated checks to confirm code correctness as you progress and improve functionality in this software to support the evolving market trading data needs and investment research models with dynamic data updates over trading environments and across many trading horizons for user benefit.

Testing frameworks cover several core functional modules: including yfinance module which provides reliable data and reporting across multiple financial assets. We perform unit and module based integration in data reporting and visualization modules as the system provides graphical output, so these checks verify data integrity across various asset models with data validation checks, and error exception to confirm the robustness against unexpected inputs for user benefit, improving reliability to meet needs with data reporting

To ensure consistent results and minimize integration dependencies, testing utilizes mocked and virtual versions of API data. The tests provide automated validation across multiple data reporting modules. Testing can also simulate real data to evaluate data robustness, as a final verification before release to meet users with accurate and stable market data insights in an investment research model




## Troubleshooting

The script frequently errors from the internet and yfinance data not found for stock tickers and data retrieval due to various conditions like data errors, internet connection disruptions. This may happen if incorrect syntax of ticker is specified which may not resolve with simple corrections as some markets do have different universes or exchanges which can influence this process with data discrepancies and inconsistencies that require data updates with corrections or alternate tickers with data identifies from sources.  These can cause the system from processing, or data retrieval issues from stock market sources for financial assets across trading platforms that should not be ignored to provide users the best reporting.

Common dependency installation failure during installation often arises, with the `pip` package installation fails if system has not configured proper environments, such as `gcc`,  to ensure that python is installed, the system can handle dependencies with a clean build for a smooth integration to avoid issues from data import or calculations and prevent unexpected issues with reporting and user-side integration across different system platforms and idempotency in software builds. 

When the system generates reports incorrectly and produces invalid outputs, data formatting can influence output errors as a source which needs validation as an error and correction, or data type conflicts. To avoid, it needs data verification as validation checks including checking types for inputs from external sources with correct reporting and error handling as needed across data processing layers. This helps with the reporting module in ensuring accuracy for financial investment reports with dynamic trading information from various sources, providing accurate insights into data reports.




## Performance and Optimization

The code prioritizes optimization by implementing techniques. Lazy Evaluation minimizes computation when processing large dataset which helps with data analysis to prevent delays or bottlenecks.  The application makes the code to minimize the memory by processing the required and filtering non needed items, and storing information as compressed format and iterations of caching, providing more memory available on lower system specifications. 

Data retrieval through efficient data access with API endpoints and efficient data structure to prevent excessive load, while also utilizing optimized algorithm that improve calculations in time efficiency to provide accurate data and reporting to improve processing times

Parallel processing techniques can reduce the overall analysis runtimes by splitting workloads, improving the ability to manage increased data load and faster processing for more rapid generation to facilitate the users in faster insights from data to meet market-demands of financial assets

Future iterations include implementing distributed computing with a system of data and model scaling across clusters, enhancing capabilities and reducing overall system resource utilization in supporting data-intense financial analytics applications with improved efficiency.   



## Security Considerations

The `config.yaml` must protect data, especially for secrets, such as credentials that are sensitive to market data and asset reporting to secure financial information for trading, using proper file encryption, to prevent unwanted or malicious actions and protect sensitive trading and information access for user and platform benefits and ensure secure and compliant usage. Data Validation helps prevent code infliction attacks through strict and consistent checking in API parameters before being injected in the system by validating data input for malicious or corrupted input from third parties

Regular Security scans are important across multiple levels for system integrity which helps prevent vulnerabilities. Regularly running security scans helps detect known threats or issues with system architecture that should prevent intrusion by third-party actors with potential vulnerabilities.   Security scans will help improve and reinforce secure trading data access models.
