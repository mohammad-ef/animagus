# Contributors Guildeline

## ** 1.Introduction **

We warmly invite you  to contribute! Your participation, regardless of size, helps our community thrive and improves our shared project. Every contribution, from small fixes to new feature, helps us build and sustain a vibrant community for everyone.

Contributing isn 't limited to just code. Documentation updates, test coverage improvements, and thoughtful feature suggestions, as valuable, so we are happy to see contributions of those type and value them, and we appreciate the community involvement. This document outlines the steps involved. Let’s work together to create a fantastic resource!

## ** 2.Code of Conduct**

Our community values respectful interactions among all involved participants. Treat fellow contributors with kindness and empathy, and foster a welcoming collaborative work. Construct feedback, even if it is tough to hear, should be delivered respectfully and thoughtfully, as we value each opinion, and encourage a safe, collaborative work area.

Har harassment, discrimination, or any behaviour that could create a negative atmosphere is absolutely intolerable. Our goal is to maintain a safe working environment, and anyone not following guidelines will have actions taken on their involvement. A safe, welcoming and productive workspace is our collective duty, and it benefits the entire community.. 

We are all in this journey to make the best product together, so we ask that you join and respect all community guidelines as stated above. 

## ** 3 . Getting Started**
  
To start contributing effectively, you will need the project installed on your personal machine. First fork the project from the main repository, then clone the fork down to your local development workspace.. Ensure your local environment meets the project's system requirements which are listed in the project ' README '.

We recommend you create a feature or fix branch, so you can maintain your personal changes without impacting main. Use a naming convention such as ` feature/new-awesome-component ` or ` fix/typo-in-documentation`. This ensures a clean work environment, as we are using branching to maintain project stability and ease of collaboration. 

To start building and test the project, follow the steps outlined in the README: ` yarn install` or ` npm install` to grab dependencies , followed by `yarn build`. This ensures a clean and easy starting experience, so contributors are set up quickly! We encourage a thorough setup to minimize build and testing challenges down the line

## ** 4. How to Contribute**

The best way to make a difference is to get involve! You can help by reporting bugs when you find problems, by suggesting features and enhancements that would improve the project, and, most of all, by submitting your code and documentation changes via carefully crafted pull requests.

Improving our documentation is a vital contribution. Clear, concise and up-to -date documentation makes the project accessible to new users and reduces the number of common support requests. This helps the community, by providing clear documentation, as we can all work with the project better with proper information and knowledge.
   
Before undertaking substantial work, please discuss it with the core project maintainers. This avoids wasted time spent on work that isn’t in sync. We are a team!

We welcome any contribution, big or small, and value anyone that can contribute. The project relies on community contributions for it to thrive in the industry. Please get started, and feel free to reach out with any assistance

##  **5. Reporting Bugs**

When encountering a bug or an unexpected behavior, it ' s important to report it with all the relevant details. Start by describing the issue, outlining which steps lead to it, what output or behavior was exhibited, and what you expected.

The most useful bug reports include a **reproducible example**. This can be a code snippet, a test case, or a sequence of steps, so the maintainers can quickly recreate the issue, and debug it quicker, which benefits the entire community. 

To report a bug or a potential issue, please create a new issue on the [GitHub Issues page](link to your GitHub issues page). This will keep the discussions organized, and easily accessible. 

## **6 . Suggesting Enhancements**

Have a new idea, feature, or improvement for the project? We would love it! Start by creating a new issue on the [GitHub Issues page](link to GitHub issues page) with a detailed description of your suggestion. 

Clearly articulate the motivation and potential use cases for your suggestion. This allows the maintainers to see the value it adds. Providing any mockups or diagrams helps communicate better to other contributors on ideas.

Project maintainers regularly review submitted suggestions and evaluate the potential value in accordance with existing roadmaps, and overall direction, which may be influenced from feedback received..  The decision about what to prioritize and whether and when a change can happen.  Be aware the acceptance can vary!

##  ** 7. Pull Request Process**

Follow these steps when submitting your contributions using a pull request, to maintain stability of codebase! Ensure your work branch has clear connection to origin main/dev by using, ` git fetch origin ` to sync local branches and avoid merge conflicts

Before starting a change on code: Use  `git checkout -b feature/my-feature ` for starting new branch with feature. After you made necessary code, use commands ` git add . `, followed by ` git commit -m "feat: Implemented the X features for component".`. This helps maintain consistency and allows us track what was updated to improve future releases!

Make sure your code is well formatted to maintain project guidelines as described below, and include unit test to maintain functionality; otherwise it might take a longer for review team to get involved. We value consistency and clean codes. Finally, you can submit changes and use  `git push origin feature/my-feature `. We will review your code closely, and feedback might occur

## ** 8. Coding Standards**

Our coding standard helps in keeping the project readable, understandable, and consistent in every area of work. We want our product accessible, clean and easy to debug and improve for future development cycles. Use an indention that follows 4-space standard as we value consistency and a well written codebase! 

Variable names must adhere to naming best practice and should use the appropriate data naming to reflect functionality and value data represents. Use camelCase, with a lowercase first name. For constants or variables, all upper casing must be observed with words seperated by underscors! 

Use tools like ` eslint ` to ensure the codebase remains compliant and clean in formatting. Also run tests, because it will ensure code quality remains stable in long term, and maintain project standards across every contribution!

## ** 9. Testing Guidelines**

Before you submitting pull request ensure tests pass on every contribution made; failing to test and validate code leads to issues. Tests must also run on a CI server and be passed. The project use framework like ` Jest` as the preferred tool set

Write at least a few test units covering new changes you've added for code changes made, as tests must run and maintain code health over longer period. We want the system and all components stable!

If the tests have been updated to add tests on your work and pass successfully, that ensures stability! Run the test by typing  `npm test` from command-line or the IDE you using

## ** 10. Documentation Contributions**

The more well the product and all aspects documented and maintained for contributors; that will lead the better project overall! Please update all documents in  [your documentation repo folder path]. Use consistent writing and tone!

Please follow markdown formatting conventions and keep them in the appropriate sections as we need clear information.  If adding images/illustrations make them concise. 

If some document pages are unclear; please improve and submit pull request; otherwise there could potential misunderstanding in code implementation. Documentation should maintain accessibility as all contributors and future users!

## ** 11. Commit Message Guidelines**

Commit messages act as a project log and help us to easily review code. They also helps other collaborators easily understand the scope changes of project. A clear description can make a difference on codebase maintainability!

We encourage to using of **conventional commits** such as using:  `feat: Implemented user authentification`. The use the proper scope is a good best practice that helps us to identify which section changed or which feature. Use present to explain action!

Please include what was the reason the changes were applied as well; so it helps understand scope! If any changes cause conflicts to future changes. Use consistent and meaningful messaging

## ** 12. Branching Model**

Our primary branching strategy follow the `git flow` for stability and manageability. The project `main` and `develop` are main branching for releases, while new contribution happens with dedicated branching to allow keep changes safe, without interfering existing features

We ask developers to start their development from a fork on origin branch. For new changes use feature branch. To maintain code, make a fix-based feature/ fix from development

The branching names follows pattern as described such `feature/x`, `bugfix/x`, to identify scope for each change; which allows maintain code better for team members

## ** 13. Review Process**

The pull request goes under several reviews before they merge; maintainers carefully scrutinizes the pull request as code. Please ensure code and document meets our standards. It is okay if there some issues that come up! 

If a change requests further changes to be performed. It should take approximately a week for response, so keep track for changes to make sure they implemented

## ** 14. Communication Channels**

We are eager for collaboration in the journey to make our code work! The best ways is communicate through the Github issue trackers to track progress! 

Also the project community stay connected through  [discord community link](https://example/community/channel ) . We will provide support on there if anything has any problems on contribution

We are here to collaborate together, if anything goes, reach out, so you get better support on contributions to improve! 

## **15. Security and Responsible Disclosure**

When finding security bugs please report them to maintainers as private to avoid any exploitation, we need the security vulnerabilities. If we can patch the issues quicker, so there aren no issues on future! 

Please **DO NOT** publicly disclose vulnerability, because that might affect project, users can easily abuse! Instead please contact the maintainers via a dedicated private reporting channels.

The maintainers are committed at patching vulnerabilities within the given timeline, we appreciate your cooperation with security standards. 

## **16. Release Process**
    
A new release follows version standard; and it includes tagging and changelog for the users! Tag the version by  `git tag -a release/v1.0.0` to identify changes. Also create an associated version log!

When releasing new releases we also want to document it properly on for end-user documentation. The goal of our work on code to improve and keep codebase maintainable, we will be happy for future collaboration and improvement for codebase to grow together. 

Also remember semantic verision standards! 

## **17. Recognition**

As an open community, contribution matters and needs recognition; and to acknowledge each individual's help and participation to keep community vibrant, as that motivates contributors, we list them.  
Maintain contributors listing, and acknowledge contributors! 

We appreciate your effort for contributions on code as our goal as project! Let continue our collaborative development and growth!   

## ** 18. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**

Please ensure all submissions have been agreed for licensing for project ownership as this can impact quality. Please ensure you have accepted a [Contributor License Agreement CLA]( link ).   The agreement is intended and protect ownership for everyone while keeping our open community alive

We are eager on contribution of your time and knowledge as it will improve the project over-all for users and maintain project goals as whole; as such CLA help facilitate it! 

## ** 19. Resources and References**

Refer and consult these resource links on project! For project guidelines on styling consult on the following:

 [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

For style guides consult: 
[Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).  This keeps us standardized with code implementation and readability as team
