# Contributors

Your contributions are essential for making the [Project name here] a successful and thriving community. We're grateful for your willingness to share your time and skills! This document outlines how others can engage to support our software by offering assistance. 

We highly encourage anyone interested in joining our project, even with simple tasks, should read through the guidelines and feel comfortable in the steps to make contributions. Contributions are a great means to learn as a software engineer but we are always welcoming other types of input as well like design, marketing, or even general community building and management! 

We want to ensure this is a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. Your contributions are valued, regardless of your coding experience! Please take note of all of our requirements, as this document will help ensure your efforts are well aligned with our development goals and maintain consistency across contributions to our project.

 ## 1. Welcome Message

 We are very happy you are here, and would love your participation! This is a fantastic way to learn the ropes and grow together with our existing team. Please read through our requirements carefully. If you are unsure about how to do anything, ask questions! 

 Our open-source community relies heavily on contributors, from seasoned programmers to those just beginning the journey - and we are thankful for your interest. Together we can ensure this tool grows to meet everyone' needs, which will allow this platform to grow.  

 Our goal is to create a supportive community for everyone involved - from code contributions to helping guide new developers and community building efforts. Your support in this endeavor is highly valued so we ask you to follow our standards to make that possible!

## 2. Conduct

This community is committed to fostering inclusive, welcoming, respectful and collaborative open-source project environment for everyone involved with our software and platform. Please be respectful of everyone' opinions and feedback - and be considerate when discussing our platform and goals.

Disruptive, hostile, or discriminatory behavior is strictly prohibited. That encompasses harassment of any kind, and we ask you to be thoughtful in all your communication. Violations can and will result in removal from the project and potentially more depending on the scope. 

We believe that diverse teams create better software and are stronger as a collaborative community as we learn from different perspectives and expertise. Our team welcomes feedback, questions, suggestions - and we expect those to be shared with respect and good will toward each other. If you have concerns or issues about any member of our team, please let a moderator or maintain know and we address it.   

## 3. Getting Started

The first step is to clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone [repository URL]`. After cloning, `cd` into the project directory. This allows easy access to our files and source codes. This is the beginning of our collaborative work, and we are so happy you have found our platform and have decided to participate and contribute to our software!     

Next, navigate to the project's root directory. From here it is possible to setup the local dependencies. This step is important, and if done improperly, your project may not be built or run correctly. Please be thorough when installing our tools or libraries!   

To install the necessary dependencies (using pip for example), you can generally follow these steps:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
poetry install #if poetry is installed
```

Create a new branch based on your local `main` branch for any modifications or new functionalities. You should use a descriptive name: such as: `your-username / feature-new-functionality`.

 ## 4. Contributing

We welcome various contributions to [Project Name Here], not just code! Bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and community engagement all make a difference - and we are appreciative of the time invested to ensure this software is top-notch!

Feel free to report any bugs you encounter, or propose new enhancements through our issues and discussions sections on our GitHub repo. Don 't worry about being an experienced programmer, and we are thankful for all kinds of feedback - even general thoughts or ideas!  

Please note, it is best to first discuss significant architectural changes before committing to the code. Opening up the issue with the team allows collaboration on design and reduces risk of unnecessary rework later! We love hearing new ideas!  

If documentation is unclear, missing, or needs updating, don 't be shy! Contributing to our READMEs or other documentation files is incredibly impactful and makes things so much more easier for others! 

 ## 5. Bug Reporting

When filing a bug, the most critical thing is ensuring it can be easily reproduced by our development team to address it properly. Please provide clear, detailed steps to replicate the issue, including what you tried and what results you experienced. This allows the bug to be reproduced in an identical state!     

Please share the full error messages that you see in conjunction with your issue description. This will give us a lot of additional insights, to assist our debugging and analysis to find out what happened! Also including relevant environment or platform information is very useful!     

We encourage users to check that the bug hasn 't be already filed before submitting a new report. It may be a case where we are already working on it and we are thankful for you confirming that you can experience the bug as well.  

Report bugs through creating an appropriate issue on our [GitHub repository' issues section]. Be as specific as possible - the more information you can give us, helps our team!     

##6. Suggestions

New ideas make our projects grow! Please submit feature suggestions via [GitHub repository' Issues Section/ Discussions]. We are excited to see your ideas and suggestions!      

We appreciate it when you can provide as much information as possible - like how would you implement it, and what are the potential use cases of the proposed feature or enhancement! 

All suggestions are reviewed by maintain team members as a part of our development process. We carefully consider each proposal - and prioritize it based on factors such as impact, complexity, and project scope!      

We'd also love to get community feedback on existing features and improvements! Don 't hesitate to share your ideas, suggestions, and perspectives - we are very thankful for all your input to our team!     

##7. Pull Request

Once you have made the changes, you should make commits to the branch you created earlier. Please use descriptive messages that summarize the work you completed. It helps with code readability and collaboration across teams.

After committing your changes locally, push the branch to your GitHub repository using the command: `git push origin your-branch-name`. Now you can open create a pull request ( PR ) from your branch on our GitHub repository.     

Before merging PR into our main branch, our team will review your code for adherence to standards and best practices. We may ask for revisions or modifications based on our team review - and you should always be open to collaboration during the PR review to make your code as clean and well-structured as possible!      

After approval, maintainers and merge the PR, your contribution would become a part of [Project Name Here]'s core code, and we are thankful for all contributions! 

## 8. Coding

Our goal is to maintain a consistent and well-structured codebase. We adhere to [Language] Style Guidelines, including proper indentation (usually 4 spaces), clear and concise code and meaningful naming - to maintain consistency and make our platform easier to read.

We use [Linter/Formatter Name] to automatically enforce our coding style and formatting rules. This tool automatically fixes many common problems, and keeps the codebase looking and working as it should! 

Please use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, function, and classes. This ensures our codebase is self-documenting and easily readable for everyone who works with this product! 

## 9. Testing

Testing is a critical aspect of the contribution process. Please write unit tests that cover your changes, ensuring the feature performs as intended and the existing code is not impacted. This protects our code from regressions and ensures we provide the best software as possible!

Our project uses the [Testing Framework] for writing tests. Familiarize yourself using the framework and how we write our tests. 

We also encourage the integration of integration and end-to-end tests to simulate the user interactions and verify the system is working as a whole.

## 10. Documentation
We strive for complete and accurate information in every part of our documentation - and would be thankful for your help! Please contribute to our documentation by updating or adding any necessary information - and we are thankful for all support!

The primary documentation lives inside the `docs/ ` or similar directory. If you are improving an existing section, make sure your edits maintain consistency in formatting and terminology!      

When submitting a new feature, or enhancement - be sure to document how it is used. Also, include any known quirks or potential edge cases that could be a problem for our developers - and we are very thank you to our community in providing this feedback as it protects our team as well!      

## 11. Commit Messages
Clear and consistent commit messages are important for our team! They allow our developers to understand our project history and easily revert if needed - and this is a critical part of our contribution process!      

We recommend using the [Conventional Commits] standard for commit message formatting. This includes prefixing the message with a keyword like `feat:`, `fix:`, or `docs:`, followed by a short explanation of the code modification.       

Please keep each commit small and focused on a single logical unit of work. This makes code reviews and debugging easier and ensures we can keep track of our team!      

## 12. Branching

We follow [Branching Strategy Name] which helps us manage contributions and releases. We use a main branch where the stable code exists, and we create new branches for developing new things!      

When contributing a new feature, you should branch from our ` main` or ` develop` branches, depending on our current release cycle. Make sure your name is in line with our standard: feature/my-new-function and we are thankful for the contribution!  

## 13. Reviews

All pull requests require approval from a maintainer prior to merging.  During the PR review, we will examine your code for correctness, code clarity, and alignment with our style guide!      

We appreciate it if you can promptly address and incorporate requested feedbacks from maintainer. We are all learning together as a team, and we will ensure we all grow as a community to build top-level product!      

Once your PR is approved and merged, your change will become part of the [Project Name Here]!
