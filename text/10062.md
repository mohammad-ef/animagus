# How We Contribute

Welcome! We're thrilled you expressed interest in contributing to our project. Contributions of any size, from bug reports to large features, are warmly welcome as they are vital fuel for our progress and growth of the project ecosystem.

Open source is driven by its people and their shared efforts. By joining us, you'll contribute to an evolving community dedicated to improving the project and making it the tool people rely on. We value the knowledge, experience and enthusiasm that new community members bring.

We believe in making this a welcoming and supportive environment. Your participation, regardless of your experience level, will significantly contribute to the project’s quality and longevity. So let’s get right into how to do so and contribute meaningfully.


 # Code of Conduct

 We expect everyone to treat collaborators, visitors and community in a kind and respectful manner and contribute to a supportive ecosystem. We value collaboration, and we strive to create an inviting space where all individuals feel safe and encouraged to share ideas and work together.

 Harassment, discrimination, or any behaviour that undermines a welcoming environment will not be tolerated and results in being asked to leave the collaboration as well as possible legal action as determined on a case by case basis. We are committed to maintaining a professional and constructive community environment.

 We encourage everyone to be empathetic and mindful of the impact that comments can have. Remember that online communications can be easily taken the wrong way, so it is essential to communicate with respect and understanding to foster a positive working atmosphere that allows all to contribute and grow. We all learn from each other as contributors as this community is built upon shared experience! 


# Getting Started 

Before contributing, you must set up our local development environment and clone the project. First, fork the repository on GitHub. Then, clone your fork locally using  `git clone <your_fork_URL>`. Navigate into the cloned directory using `cd <project_name >`.

Next, you should install necessary tools. For example, you might install `Node.js` with version at least `16.x` using a package manager of your choosing. Then you should install project dependencies via the appropriate means for the language. We use `npm install` to do so, which can be run within the project root folder after Node.js is installed.

To start development, you will need to configure an editor and a Git client for local changes. Make your changes to your local environment, committing frequently while developing. Ensure that each branch reflects a single goal, which helps with review and testing.

We use Git Flow branching model for our projects, which will be further explained later within this file. Create a new branch by checking out a new local branch using the command `git checkout -b <feature_name >` for each feature or fix you work on. 

Finally, before submitting, make sure all local changes are pushed to your forked repository. This enables a smoother contribution experience as you prepare for submitting a merge request.



# How to Contribute 

There are many ways to help improve the project, both through code and non-code contributions. You can submit bug reports, contribute to documentation, help with testing, suggest enhancements and even provide design feedback.

If you find a bug, please report it. If you notice areas where the documentation can improve, go ahead and update it with your knowledge. Every contribution helps the project grow. 

When implementing new changes, especially larger ones or complex refactorings please communicate your intentions by first creating an issue and discussing the implementation before you implement it to ensure that the work meets our expectations. This also avoids wasted effort if the proposed approach needs adjustments.

Before submitting a pull request with code, it is critical that you ensure your tests pass, and your code follows our established style conventions and coding standards. This ensures code compatibility and reduces review burden on contributors leading to an expedited approval and merge into our project! 

Remember your participation contributes not only directly but by creating and sharing resources as an open-source community, it fosters the project!


# Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, reporting it is invaluable for maintaining a stable product.  To help us efficiently identify and address issues, clearly and accurately explain what went wrong and include any information about your configuration (hardware and software details, and specific settings if appropriate). 

Create a minimal, reproducible example demonstrating the bug by isolating the specific actions that lead to failure and include them into your submission, if you're unable to identify such steps describe them concisely for the developers, as detailed information leads to efficient issue resolution and a smoother code update experience. 

Use GitHub's "Issues" feature to submit bug reports and provide clear subject line like: 'Bug - <Concise Description of Bug >' or a short phrase. The GitHub bug system helps us maintain accountability, track the status, and communicate effectively.




# Suggesting Enhancements

Suggesting enhancements can shape the product. Share ideas to elevate the software and enhance users overall engagement, but make sure suggestions align with project scope.  To do so clearly outline why an enhancement is needed or desired - detailing motivation helps assess feasibility and importance of an upgrade and to better understand use cases involved and potential benefit to existing community usage.

Provide concrete details and examples for each suggestion including potential use cases or how to incorporate your proposed changes into the codebase as detailed descriptions will facilitate better understanding and evaluation during reviews to assess impact and alignment to long-term roadmap of existing functionality and goals of our development process.

All suggested features undergo careful assessment from maintainers to assess its value against effort as the decision making criteria takes several variables into account including impact for community benefit versus engineering investment, project alignment, resource requirements as we try our best to deliver quality enhancements with efficient engineering and time allocation to deliver best product experience!




# Pull Request Process

Before you open a pull request, create a branch named after your changes: `git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>` or `fix/<issue-id>`. Make your code and tests passing and push these locally, as `git push origin <your-branch>`. After which an interface for a pull request is generated automatically for a code comparison.

Provide a descriptive title summarizing the purpose of these code improvements such as a bug fixed to a critical system component and ensure a succinct description detailing scope as details are essential when collaborating on an existing project, allowing all team members a clear context on scope as a part of collaborative contribution!

The PR's code gets tested automatically using various linters to identify potential stylistic or coding errors that need attention or further investigation as well automated builds, running integration testing, code validation. Address feedback during code review from your collaborators promptly. 



# Coding Standards

We strive to keep consistency within codebase for improved clarity for contributors by following strict standards that apply when contributing to any of our existing and new repositories by adhering to a set guidelines, as it ensures readability by any member, reducing debugging difficulties!  Proper indentation (typically 2 spaces), appropriate capitalization and clear commenting help maintain clean coding standards and make codebase easy to work in a collective fashion

Our code follows a set of rules to prevent any coding style inconsistencies by using static analysis tools and a code formatting tools which will catch issues like unused variables or long line limits automatically which help in keeping our repositories neat! Ensure linting is passed as one aspect that we value, along with comprehensive testing and code review by our community, and ensure all automated tooling pass before a commit is merged

The codebase documentation is kept inline within the relevant modules, ensuring that it accurately describes the intended functions of the module to achieve high levels of code coverage and maintainability, promoting ease for developers and maintainers to keep it updated and aligned with code functionality for optimal developer and maintenance experience


# Testing Guidelines

Our projects heavily utilize comprehensive test suite that is essential, covering every feature of product as part of development lifecycle, including unit testing that focuses in isolated units and integration to validate the system's components interact appropriately as well as automated test suite as an ongoing part.

Our projects primarily use [Insert Test Framework Here], a widely recognized unit-testing system and can use the test running utility to test local files by entering `test_running_instruction`. Make tests pass and add additional testing as tests directly influence reliability.  New testing code is added to our repository and will go through a similar testing review.

Always strive to implement testable designs to enable automated checks during development process, to guarantee high product and development team satisfaction, minimizing risks from bugs by providing assurance of product and system stability to improve reliability over existing systems!




# Documentation Contributions

Updating our existing or contributing a documentation can dramatically affect a userbase by helping improve overall adoption.  To contribute, navigate directly to documentation file and submit an improved update by making clear, precise and concise improvements while following coding standard, which helps to ensure consistent documentation style as we want users to quickly access necessary details to resolve questions. 

Existing code-bases often contain a README folder containing all necessary project instructions including how to use or interact, contributing or developing. All documentation contributions should include comprehensive examples that highlight functionality to assist user experience.

Please review any existing changes for alignment and accuracy to avoid any inconsistencies, and make edits to avoid any unnecessary technical or coding language.




# Commit Message Guidelines

Commit messages help keep the codebase understandable to contributors while making a history easier to follow when troubleshooting an issue! A clear subject with 50 character length is a general guide to commit messages for brevity in understanding.  We adhere strongly to a format which helps ensure readability and maintain a cohesive understanding when navigating codebase!

Follow Conventional Commits as the recommended standard. This provides clarity to commit type (`fix`, `feat`, `docs`), subject that accurately captures intent. For examples use `feat: Added ability to upload documents`.  These standardizations improve collaboration when contributing!

Descriptive commits are key, as they help future team members comprehend intentions when resolving an issue as they also improve our automation, making version release, tracking scripts or documentation automatic for a scalable project management solution as we continue evolving over existing and upcoming releases! 




# Branching Model

We adhere to a `Gitflow` branching model in managing development lifecycle for all repositories in the ecosystem. As we utilize multiple, separate and independent branching to maintain long and robust code-base while allowing rapid development and experimentation of features without disrupting stability and production readiness, it is essential.

Always make development off the latest from our Main (Stable release), so we keep stability and reliability for production releases! The process for doing this will depend heavily on team-wide standards that maintain a clean development flow. Feature/ fix changes are implemented off this `main` branch for easier review

Naming branches consistently is vital to our workflow; therefore feature branches must use naming pattern prefixed `feature/<relevant descriptor for function>`. Fix pull request naming uses the convention named prefixed for the relevant issue ticket to easily tie it together when merging into `main`




# Review Process

Every Pull Request contribution undergoes a detailed assessment and evaluation for correctness of coding practices and standards as part of quality process following submission for integration into product ecosystem. Review comments help to ensure the highest quality product with all stakeholders on same understanding to prevent any future bugs.

Expect reviewers asking clarifications of implementation choices, or request code improvements which will be handled respectfully as the purpose is constructive to refine and polish product with a positive attitude for everyone to improve overall contribution, as a collaborative team,

Following code changes, we will run the build again. A passing and merged change signifies a stable contribution that goes straight into codebase which is then version-controlled into product.




# Communication Channels

Our communication takes places over the various open source channels that we provide as one way for collaboration and communication! Please refer to `github Issues and PR discussions` which provides a direct line to discuss changes as well provide feedback with associated community, so please use the available platforms and tools as a result for efficient discussion and resolution of issues to maintain high product experience

# Security and Responsible Disclosure

Reporting of a potential vulnerabilities and bugs needs to occur via direct channel as the security aspect and integrity needs top importance for a lasting ecosystem as part of our core commitment and promise

We strongly emphasize that disclosure to security researchers and stakeholders be kept confidentially before the team addresses the problem so we may implement and fix bugs efficiently without causing widespread public exposure and potential risk. We are deeply committed on a rapid remediation process!

Direct security issues at `security@ourdomain.com`. All vulnerabilities should follow this channel, for us to resolve and maintain high security!




# Release Process

A formal procedure exists when a code update and changes require formal product rollout into the production systems for general users, to maintain and control the process and minimize unnecessary disruption for our users to have smooth transition and experience! The team initiates a series of rigorous quality testing for a comprehensive check

New versions will undergo thorough code analysis to guarantee all features align perfectly and integrate flawlessly to provide consistent experiences. Tagging releases is essential to version tracking so all future development efforts can accurately reference and improve previous code as necessary and required.

Finally changes are updated to our change log file. Semantic versioning practices must be employed when planning and managing deployments as a standard of the release process!




# Recognition

We deeply appreciate the hardwork and the contribution by each community partner, and strive on recognizing diverse talents, expertise, dedication to help with growth as the team works toward creating high standard of community experience that fosters trust and respect amongst the stakeholders as part of core value

Contributor lists get published to various places across platforms, as it helps to promote awareness for each member, with a public thank-you to highlight and encourage more participation and dedication towards community and project success along with all contributors as it promotes trust in project longevity.

We will provide professional recognition and highlight exceptional contribution through social media channels that help highlight our contributors!
