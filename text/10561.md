## 1. Code of Conduct

We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors and users. Please review our Code of Conduct [link to Code of Conduct]. Our code of conduct is designed to protect contributors. 

We expect all members of the community to interact with respect and empathy. Unconstructive criticism, harassment, or any form of discriminatory behavior will not be tolerated. We foster open-minded conversations where differing opinions can flourish while being mindful of all participants, 

 Violations of our Code of Conduct will result in warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans from the project and associated communities, depending on the severity and context of the transgression. By participating, you are agreeing to adhere to this agreement, which contributes towards our community.

## 2. Getting Started

Before diving in, make sure you have [Programming Language/Tool] and [Dependencies] installed on your system. Detailed setup instructions are available [link to Setup Documentation or Wiki]. You need to clone the git repository: `git clone [repository URL]`. Navigate into the directory and you must run setup command for dependencies. 

After the installation steps above, set up a separate branch for your contributions: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`. We prefer separate branches as you make any change as to prevent breaking anything during your workflow. 

It's always recommended to rebase frequently against the `main` branch, especially as you are working towards making pull requests: `git rebase main`. Before you commit, remember to run code formatting or code linters. You may install pre-commit hooks or linters locally. 

We recommend you familiarize yourself with `main` by pulling in all commits from it `git pull origin main`. After this initial commit is performed, ensure to test the program before attempting the Pull Request workflow as described later. We are happy to guide anyone with issues as we genuinely appreciate all efforts in our development lifecycle.

## 3. How to Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to [Project Name]. The main paths typically are code changes through a Pull Request (PR) which may stem from either bug fixing or suggesting features, however you may submit feedback, improve the code documentation, help in code reviewing of incoming contributions or test out newly developed components.  

Contributing through a good issue helps the whole project by ensuring all potential flaws are identified before being propagated to users, while contributing to testing efforts allows a team to be reassured with quality, while feature submissions ensure a relevant product with an ever growing community, as new needs may surface with new uses cases of a particular program. 

Before you implement significant changes, open an issue or create a discussion. We encourage collaboration before implementation to ensure that the effort aligns with project goals. Discuss the potential scope and direction, as that allows other team members to give advice to the contributor to improve the overall result and minimize any rework or unexpected results.

Feel free to reach out with any suggestions for enhancements that you might consider for improvement in any aspects, even outside code. 

## 4. Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug while using [Project Name], please help us fix it by reporting it! First, try to reproduce the bug in a controlled environment, and then gather information that may prove valuable.

To submit a bug report, head over to our GitHub repository [link to GitHub Issues]. Please be detailed! The better the info the higher chances of quick bug verification or fixes from our teams, which ultimately ensures users get what they need with a functional product. 

A minimal reproducible example can drastically increase the rate at which bugs can be identified or solved by others as a minimal environment helps reduce any external noise. Make sure to describe the environment you observed this on. Please be specific and explain all steps needed to observe such issue.

## 5. Suggesting Enhancements

Got an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? Fantastic!  We appreciate innovative input as new feature proposals ensure that [Project Name] can be relevant over extended use case horizons. However a thoughtful feature can improve the user journey as users become comfortable and explore different features.

To share your suggestion, create a new issue on GitHub with the label "[feature request]". Clearly explain the problem you aim to solve or the opportunity to capitalize. Include use cases for why users would benefit and what would happen with the addition.

Your request is then reviewed by the maintainers, who take into account various factors: complexity, priority, impact, alignment with our project road map and feasibility of adding that into an already planned release cycle. It is worth bearing in mind as the feature increases in value it becomes an ever growing benefit in a user's life cycle of a project.

## 6. Pull Request Process

Creating a pull request is the standard process for contributing code changes to [Project Name]. Start by creating a new branch off the `main` branch named descriptively like `feature/my-awesome-feature` or `fix/typo-in-docs`.

Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages that accurately reflect your changes, as we value code consistency across contributions for better team cohesion and understanding when auditing a specific change over extended lifecycles of an application or product. 

After pushing your changes to your remote branch and testing to assure correctness in local, open a pull request against the `main` branch of our repository and make it as comprehensive as possible as this allows reviewer's time to efficiently check all components. We expect thorough and consistent quality of contributions to keep code consistent, clean and easy to reason over when debugging any edge-case problems down the road. 

The request will be checked for quality as maintainers check code against code review guidelines. After approval and all checks are successful it will get merged as part of project development!

## 7. Coding Standards

Maintain consistent coding standards across all project components to ensure ease of maintenance and code review, and a consistent and understandable base. This improves readability to allow new members join our team to become effective! 

Follow the Python [PEP 8 Style Guide] if working with python components of the system: [https://pep8.org/](https://pep8.org/). If writing code using JavaScript use Javascript Style Guide as it provides the basis that the JavaScript framework operates under [link to relevant guidelines] You need to format it appropriately as we are running code linters before the PR merges! 

Automated tools will perform checks such as formatting with indentation, naming conventions and style checks, but also code analysis. It may highlight any edge cases, which are the primary concern when writing any program that is deployed, especially on public infrastructure!

## 8. Testing Guidelines

Thorough testing is an essential element to any software and helps reduce any case bugs, which improves the end product overall! Make sure existing tests still pass by performing the automated build scripts as that validates everything before being submitted and tested!

We have test cases for the main program and also for all subprograms, so please be prepared with the knowledge to perform testing as those cases may involve a bit more complexity in setting up an environment for proper running tests and assertions of what we have. Ensure all the testing scripts pass before sending it off to be checked.

If implementing any functionality, always make sure to cover the changes made in the test case and that tests will cover both edge cases to reduce potential bugs and issues! This makes it an easy task for a QA to ensure a product works without bugs before going on deployment!

## 9. Documentation Contributions

Help keep [Project Name]'s documentation up-to-date and informative by adding or refining sections within `/docs/`. We strive to deliver the latest info to help anyone with using or maintaining components as the landscape for projects evolve rapidly! 

Make changes with a proper state, so you may submit them. Ensure you update relevant pages for consistency to maintain clarity and readability.

## 10. Commit Message Guidelines

Follow standard conventional commits, to quickly audit any contributions for their purposes:
- **feat:** Adds a new feature to the product.
- **fix:** Addresses a simple bug or issues
- **docs:** Updates documentation
- **style:** Formatting updates and no logic changes
- **refactor:** Modifies or cleans the current structure and implementation,
- **test:** Updates or Adds automated Tests to the product and system
- **chore:** Any project build tasks

A proper message will greatly benefit maintainers to keep code base tidy as well improve readability when audit and troubleshooting issues that are identified by others down the line, which helps improve team's cohesiveness as everyone will share benefit for better and clear coding style.

## 11. Branching Model

We use a [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/git-flow-workflow) branching model with branches being made of: `main`, `develop`, `feature`, `fix` where:

-   `main` holds stable production releases.
-   `develop` branches is intended for the latest integrations with ongoing features
-   Feature Branches will stem out from the `develop` to contain new and in work features to avoid disrupting current functionality of other branches

Please adhere strictly as any deviations can potentially cause chaos as unforeseen errors will happen once a branch goes awry with another one. This ensures all contributions and integrations flow safely to production without causing disruption in an already deployed service or application!

## 12. Review Process

We use Pull Requests (PR) as part of an integrated process of ensuring code standards, code coverage of new additions in terms of unit, and integration and system coverage to allow our team of quality auditors maintain consistent high standards to prevent any errors and edge cases as the product evolves!  

We strive to review every submission quickly with detailed guidance so everyone involved may improve in future efforts and to improve our quality, while providing guidance to ensure quality in the project, but we may sometimes take more time, but rest assured all requests have gotten proper auditing for all concerns involved and addressed! We expect constructive, detailed review and open discussion on any potential changes!

## 13. Communication Channels

Feel free to contact any of us at the GitHub Repository's [issue section](https://github.com/[repository]/issues), to get help as it helps track conversations in public space for transparency of any questions asked, answers that we provide, so the whole community learns along together, always keeping us informed to allow a more open communication to benefit anyone and improve any contributions! You may as well find some support from our Discord: [Discord invite Link].
For any sensitive questions that might be of a privacy nature we prefer to keep communication confidential to avoid potential security concerns to allow us maintain an ever safer landscape in an ongoing fashion and for all users alike.

## 14. Security and Responsible Disclosure

If you find a potential security vulnerability in [Project Name], please do **not** disclose it publicly.  Instead, immediately report it to us via [security@example.com or another designated contact].
 
Give us time to assess and fix the vulnerability before announcing it.  Public disclosure without providing an opportunity for mitigation puts users at risk. Your discretion helps keep the ecosystem of users as well protected and safe for continued operations as a product matures through a lifetime!

## 15. Release Process

Our releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) conventions which will allow us communicate effectively to external stakeholders on a particular change's nature. Tag a `git tag` and then make any updates as we prepare releases to ensure everything goes according to expectations in the lifecycle as well to communicate effectively and transparent to anyone on the changes!

After release is made it gets updated as well in our CHANGELOG to help keep history and track versions that were implemented!
We appreciate you as a contributing force, and encourage continuous feedback and participation!

## 16. Recognition

All contributors receive acknowledgement in our `AUTHORS` file in `/`, listing the people contributing and what parts or aspects that contributed towards a specific program as an act of recognizing and appreciating contributions! 
Also contributors can expect their contributions to appear within release guide and changelog, with names as they contributed and how that affected our project overall as that provides an open-source transparency. As we maintain our open standards and code of conduct!

## 17. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

As with many open source projects, [Project Name] requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).  This agreement clarifies ownership and licensing rights for code contributed to the project, ensuring it is appropriately licensed for reuse and redistribution, for the benefits and rights afforded to users of open source code!  You can find the CLA document [link to CLA].
