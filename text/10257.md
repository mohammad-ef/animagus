# CONTRIBUTING#
  
 Welcome! We are glad about your willingness to contribute to this project, making it robust and feature-rich with a great experience to all of our end-users and developers alike. All contributions are greatly encouraged and will be evaluated carefully. We aim for a welcoming, supportive community for all.

  We believe that everyone can contribute, regardless of your coding experience. Contributions are not solely about code - improving documentation, writing tutorials, providing feedback, or helping maintain community resources are incredibly valuable. Your involvement is vital as we build a thriving environment to foster innovation.

  This guide details our guidelines and provides a standardized workflow for contributors. By submitting pull requests, you confirm you' ve reviewed this guide, that you agree with our standards, and will act respectfully toward other contributors. Please read it thoroughly before submitting any contribution.
 
## 1. Code of Conduct

 We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community. All participants are expected to treat each other with respect and kindness, regardless of differences in experience, expertise, or identity. We strive to foster a collaborative and supportive environment to allow everyone to feel safe and respected. 

 Bullying, harassment, or any form of discrimination will not be tolerated. We expect all contributors to be open-minded and respectful of differing opinions and perspectives. If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact a maintainer immediately.

 Any violations of this Code of Conduct, will result in warnings, temporary suspensions, or, in severe cases, permanent bans from the project. We are determined to maintain a positive atmosphere that promotes innovation and learning in a welcoming environment.

## 2. Getting Started

   To get started, fork the repository on GitHub, then create a new branch from `main` for your changes.  Using a descriptive branch name ( e.g. `fix/typo-in-readme`, `feature/new-login`) will make reviewing your changes easier for everyone. Avoid direct commits to the `main` branch and always use a branch to manage your contributions.

   First and foremost, you will need to install the project dependencies to run it locally. This project uses `pip` for dependency installation. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project repository after checking out a local copy and you'll be ready to work! 

   To build the project from source after the initial setup is completed, launch your console from the main project directory, navigate to `build` or equivalent, and then type `python setup.py install`. If you're working within a virtual environment, please remember to activate the correct environment prior to running these commands.

  You'll now need to install and use an editor of your choosing with a good IDE to allow easy code modifications and improvements to any aspect of the project and contribute towards building out our goals.  Ensure all dependencies listed are met, as the program might not execute properly with an improper configuration!

   To start development in VS Code use "File > Open Folder", and in other IDES navigate and find project files from their directories in local machine after checking them out to allow development and improvements as needed by your workflow. 

   Finally, after any modification you should test it thoroughly before you commit, by executing the project's built-in suite or running tests in separate scripts, or via a CI tool, ensuring you are submitting the highest quality product!

## 3. How to Contribute

   This project thrives on contributions from a broad base of users, including individuals looking to add or correct new information, fix any errors and contribute improvements! Feel free to contribute via submitting bugs and enhancement reports to provide suggestions and improvements that are vital to project longevity and user support.

    You can improve our existing documentation and help other people. Documentation provides clarity for new adopters to quickly learn. Improving clarity, accuracy, and readability, helps onboard new contributors faster. 

    If there's a bug report or suggestion, it should start there. Submitting a well formatted report allows our maintainers and other users, better insight on what issues are being raised. You may even have an opportunity to provide code and submit pull requests.

    Always communicate your major proposed changes, and significant features through issue conversations, to gather insights. This way it's a collective approach as well to allow other users, broader community, contribute insights as to why a feature would need improvements before the pull request even occurs.

## 4. Reporting Bugs

   When you encounter a bug, we are glad about hearing them out! A concise but clear description will enable our maintenance crew and team understand and fix any issues that need resolving and improving overall functionality and project quality. A good bug report makes finding a resolution far more simple.

  To properly and effectively report a bug, include information about what happened, how your actions caused that, expected outcome, and what was instead received or seen on screen or console during run-time or compilation process and error states! Providing this detailed view can save considerable time to better assist our developers

   Creating a reproducible example (a concise snippet of code) demonstrates bug, allowing anyone else (developer included) replicate and resolve any error state.  If your system environment or configuration is crucial to triggering this scenario please be sure that's detailed. This makes resolution more streamlined and quick and improves quality as it is reproducible.

   To create an issue in our project on Github please create a Github Issues. Be descriptive in title (e.g. `Feature X Does not perform like this`). Also in the body provide a full bug-reporting and reproduction step as well, and what you are hoping will resolve as a feature or bug change in functionality and/or UI state!

## 5. Suggesting Enhancements

   To propose improvements for a given component, start off the suggestion process by filing an open enhancement proposal to our issues, outlining how to improve system performance in our various functionalities as part of an improvement and feature proposal. A brief but clear summary can make a significant and helpful distinction for future improvements

   A description should provide rationale on *why* this improvement should exist; this allows our reviewers gauge its value relative to other requests, and also allows other developers to provide insights and ideas that were missed or previously unexplored, or not even realized during original proposal for feature request.  It is helpful in providing potential use cases of new improvement or feature.

   Feature proposals can go a very long time with the most significant changes, requiring refinement and iterative design cycles to properly address this enhancement request, with the goal for all users being better and higher functionality of all systems involved! We'll work diligently toward resolving them, in accordance with available resource.

## 6. Pull Request Process

   After filing bug/feature request you can begin the process of making code fixes! First make appropriate change by creating local fork in Git repository, then creating separate local branch using Git with the appropriate description such as (e.g `fix/issue-55`) as part of branch convention for local development! 

   Once the code improvements or patches are in your code and all automated tooling and linters and type checks complete correctly with success, push branch using the proper commands `git push origin fix/issue-55`. After that create an issue from your GitHub account that you pushed the change to using your current working version from branch. 

   After creating the initial feature pull-request the maintainers, developers or even contributors of community may request changes for improvements, so please respond with modifications. When all reviewers or community agree, then changes get pulled/merged once more and released in subsequent versions of program/system to public domain for users or contributors who want access and/or want make future suggestions towards improvements of project

## 7. Coding Standards

   We strive to have a consistently written base codebase for readability across different teams to allow developers to be more familiar in a more cohesive architecture as they contribute their features, while maintaining project integrity as part of code review.

   The codebase should use standard formatting conventions, for consistency across project code as well! All developers must use standard 2-space indents with a tab character (instead of four spaces for indentation) throughout project, which is part of standard project requirements across environments.

   Static Analysis Tool such as flake8 with pep8 equivalent must all follow strict rules of formatting as part of coding style as it improves developer ability with easier comprehension to review code changes as they're being submitted by contributors from the project community or from internal teams and groups of contributors!

## 8. Testing Guidelines

   To guarantee that code is robust, we rely heavily on unit testing with frameworks like `unittest`. All contributed and developed code MUST provide unit and integrated/regressive unit tests and tests to be merged in to project to avoid introducing bugs into production code and system

   Ensure your tests run automatically during development with tools integrated like CI or Github Actions and can run locally on commandline using a command such as  `python -m unittest discover` for testing the changes locally with commandline before push/PR submission to the public!  

   We recommend that each change has at least one regression tests in a specific scenario to allow us easily track and resolve problems as changes accumulate or are merged over long passcode. 

## 9. Documentation Contributions

   To ensure users have great user-adoption and understand system's core components with proper instructions on getting setup/using them we maintain comprehensive, updated system and application instructions that can quickly provide users the best experience! Please feel free and help by documenting and expanding these areas to assist other users!

   Please make modifications and improvements of project documents and instructions as part of the contribution process by updating markdown-format and pushing changes to Github Repository with descriptive commits that are clearly labeled and provide the context as needed

   All document updates, corrections must be collaborative, consistent across system as a standard of our quality. We want our end users, our project contributors to feel comfortable navigating all components to ensure project's usability as part of a great system.

## 10. Commit Message Guidelines

   All Git repository changes should provide proper descriptions with clear and accurate messages to ensure maintainers quickly review/track/debug all code contributions, and also allow us understand and track changes across versions! All code should conform standard Git-messaging as well to maintain consistency with codebase and ease maintenance for everyone to better follow changes made!

   Use prefix as `feat:`. For a newly-created function `fix:`. Resolving any known-defects;`docs:`. When documentation is added or corrected to improve user-instructions! Using standardized commit prefixes allow easier tracking, categorization changes to improve maintenance workflow across developers.

   Commit messages need be brief to convey meaning while concise enough. We expect that messages describe a purpose to a contribution as a simple one to allow other developers and reviewing members quickly follow context/details/function of changes.

## 11. Branching Model

   Our team uses the standard trunk based workflow which enables all users ability and ability to contribute frequently while minimizing conflicts, with frequent merges. To allow for rapid iteration on all contributions we utilize `main` with a fast iteration model that is constantly improving and merging

   Feature work should be on their specific `feature/*` local branching and bugfix code needs their `fix/*` to ensure all changes get tested locally prior submission as feature/bugs, as they will not merge directly. We recommend that users frequently sync/integrate their work.

   Branch name should describe the intent behind changes to help with tracking. Examples can follow `feature/quickbooks-integratoin`. This provides context as to the changes in feature and purpose of that local contribution as needed during code merging review.

## 12. Review Process

   All PR requests require a code review to improve functionality and overall integrity for system/products to meet high standards as well ensure it aligns/follows standards across teams for usability! Review process should not block any contributors/contributors, instead it provides guidance easier integration

   Reviews must focus to provide guidance with constructive feedback, while focusing towards improvement/find potential areas needing further review! Timeliness and response time should also adhere, but should be communicated proactively for transparency/better alignment among team. 

   Pull-Requests after approvals can become incorporated and deployed. We strive merge quickly and release seamless, ensuring continuous integration pipelines are streamlined!

## 13. Communication Channels

   The most primary form for discussing any changes with project/community members will always occur through public/Github issues to keep track all contributions with clear history for tracking and documentation across teams.

   The primary forum of our development team to facilitate any rapid feedback for any issues with our project occurs through [insert Discord Channel] where real-time interactions rapidly allow communication across teams for better insights to ensure we all stay aligned to deliver quality product

   For any urgent or specific inquiries/feedback, direct messages/personal correspondence with core members of teams is also welcomed! Please remember be respectful any feedback or communication to provide great support as part project's growth as whole across teams, end users.

## 14. Security and Responsible Disclosure

   Our security matters a lot as well; If you encounter potential safety issue/problem with program that can cause damage with security, don't post any issues public, and immediately message us at our email security channel [email protected].  We need your prompt and immediate attention!

   To maintain access, safety of project and users and maintain security posture for systems. It takes immediate attention with rapid response as soon safety issue occurs! It helps protect project, its user data!

   Please follow steps outlined with clear reporting, providing information about vulnerability as possible without providing public information. Don not make it public.

## 15. Release Process

   Releases follow Semantic Versioning with changes/improvements being documented on the change logs in markdown to help end-users/customers to keep current version. Version increments happen with `Patch`,`Feature`,`Major`. All of the increments should provide proper version and change logs with release to public users!

   Release preparation follows a multi-stage approach to include all testing across platforms with proper regression to guarantee a robust build, stable version with no known regressions, or critical flaws as part deployment

   Once final review complete and build process is approved. It will go out into pipelines with proper tagging to release and track version. It is important that users be able easily track what they should be on with what features are enabled for best usage/experience.

## 16. Recognition

   Our community matters! All contributing individuals and/or entities are credited to contributors and change logs in markdown. Contributions get recognized for all effort to build this system/program

   Contributors who consistently deliver great features with quality contributions will be noted for recognition!  This ensures great community support/growth while encouraging great code to ensure all stakeholders in a team and across community receive appropriate credit.

## 17. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

   Before contributions will merge to this repo and public code repository, please note you agree our project with standard licensing terms of our organization to enable public access with attribution and acknowledgement to original publishers/owners and recognizes rights according to code contributions to open system/products!  This provides all users a greater access for improvements as well allows developers ability with ease. 

   If required to submit an appropriate form for acknowledgement of contribution. You should follow all CLI terms. Signing ensures ownership and rights as part our contribution to enable public domain for access across users with great attribution! Link will provided below as part the CLI.  https://link-to-cla

## 18. Resources and References
