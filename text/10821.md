# Contributors Guildines - Stellaris Project

## Contributing

Hello and warmwelcome! Thanks for considering helping shape the future of this exciting, evolving project, Stellaris! Your skills and expertise are vital in ensuring we maintain an innovative, reliable system with a welcoming development atmosphere. 

We greatlyvalue contributions and encourage anyone to help.  All contributors are a valuable asset to this project and we welcome you to get started!  We appreciate the time that contributors dedicate to enhancing this code base and look forwards to collaborating. 

We need more than just developers. We encourage designers, documenters, testers -- anyone and everyone can find something valuable for their input on. We' re grateful to have you as a part of this team. 

## Code of Conduct ## 

We aim to maintain a welcoming and respectful environment that is friendly to contributors from all backgrounds.  Har harassment, discrimination, or any other conduct that creates a toxic atmosphere will is not acceptable and will results in the action necessary.

This includes, but are not limited to, being respectful in communication, collaborating effectively, and being supportive of fellow contributors.  Remember, we all come with varied levels or understanding of the codebase, so be prepared to guide those newer to the project.

If you believe someone is acting out of line, please reach out to an maintainer to report your observations. Violation of the Code of Conduct has potential for warnings, requests to cease behavior, and permanent removal from contribution privileges. We strive to foster a collaborative and inclusive environment and will act accordingly. We are committed to keeping our community positive.

## Git Starting & Setup ## 

Setting up your local environment is crucial for seamless development and collaboration. You' ll be forking the repository on GitHub and cloning it to your personal computer in order to work on any contributions.

First, fork the Stellaris repositories. Once the fork, clone it into our local computer using Git. Make sure that you set up an authentication method such as SSH keys to allow your system to properly access your fork.

Then create a new branch for any changes being made. Branch names must begin by "feature/" or "fix/" with a short summary of what will be worked on. This helps the project maintain organization.

To start using the project, run  `npm install` (if it is a Node.js project) or ` pip insall` in terminal to get necessary dependencies installed into local system. This should get you ready to start coding right away and begin contributing.  

## How to to Contribute ##
 There is multiple ways to become a contributor! Each has its advantages to allow contributors from all different skill sets. 

We accept bug reports, feature suggestions, pull requests, and documentation improvements and encourage them all! Please review this file before contributing. It helps everyone align on contribution workflows. 

Before implementing major new functionality, it’s recommended you first initiate a discussion to gauge feasibility and alignment with our goals. Open conversations prevent rework and ensure shared expectations. It helps ensure a smoother development experience! 

Feel free to propose enhancements and improvements, even if it’s just small tweaks. All input helps us shape a better system together. We are very open to new ideas, especially in improving user experience. 

We encourage contributors from all backgrounds. Your input on documentation, style, and overall user experience is just as vital as contributions to the core functionality! A diverse team produces a stronger project.

## Reporting Bugs ##
  To report a bug or other unexpected behavior, we request that you create an issue in the Stellaris' GitHub repo. Provide as much information as feasible in order for the project's development team to understand what went wrong. 

A clear bug report should contain the following elements: a descriptive title outlining the issue; the steps to reproduce it; what happened (expected vs. actual results); the environment details (operating and system information, software dependencies), and if applicable, logs from any error messages produced.

We highly encourage creating small, reproducible examples or snippets that demonstrate the problem. This drastically helps developers diagnose and solve the issue more effectively. This dramatically speeds up resolution.   

Please search existing issues before creating a new one. Duplicate reports can delay addressing the original issue effectively. The GitHub issue will allow all stakeholders to collaborate and track the problem's status as it progresses toward resolution. This helps maintain clarity. 

## Sugesting Enhancements ##

We welcome new features and improvements that would benefit the Stellaris platform. Before implementing any changes, please submit a suggestion to the issue tracker on Github.

When outlining enhancement suggestion, describe the feature clearly, including a compelling rationale, what specific problem it solves and a brief description about its intended use. The better you describe what you are proposing, helps the team evaluate the suggestion's impact effectively.

The Stellaris maintainers prioritize and evaluate suggestions, weighing technical feasibility, alignment with project goals, and expected user impact. Feedback and clarification may be needed. The team may suggest alterations or decline suggestions. Don’t take it personal!  

Please be prepared to engage in discussions regarding your suggestions. Your input can refine the feature and ensure its best possible integration into the project. It's a collaboration to make Stellaris better.

## Pull Reequest Process ##

Before submitting changes, ensure your commits follow our coding standards to maintain consistency. Branch your work from your for repository. It is best practice that the naming convention of the feature branch starts with "feature"/"fix".

Create a clear, descriptive pull (PR) request. In the PR body provide a detailed explanation of your changes, why you made them, and what you expect to achieve. This ensures the maintainers understand and review the proposed modifications. The body helps streamline the PR process.

Use small, focused PR and each PR addresses a single logical change. Smaller changes are much easier to review and reduce risks of conflicts. This keeps the workflow organized.

After submitting the PR, it will enter a review process. Be responsive to maintainers' comments and feedback. It may be necessary to revise the PR before the final merge can be completed. 

## Coing Standards ## 
We strive for maintain a consistent and readable codebase. The coding is essential for future contributions to be smooth.

Indentation of 4 spaces is strictly mandatory. Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Consistent is essential for code readability and reduces errors and makes the project easier to maintain.

Adhere to the existing style guide of the project or any specified language- specific style guides (e.g., Google Style Guide for Python). Linters and automated formatting tools are often used to enforce standards.

## Testing Guidelines ##
  Writing tests is paramount to the quality of Stellaris. We expect contributors to provide thorough test coverage for all submitted changes.

The project utilizes a test framework to run and evaluate the test cases. Familiarizing yourself with these tools is critical for ensuring the code functions as expected. 

When submitting new code or changes, write corresponding unit tests to test the specific components. Additionally, integrate and regression tests are also welcomed. Integration tests verify that various components interact correctly as expected. 

## Documentation Contributions ##
Accurate and comprehensive documentation is an important part of our codebase. Contributions towards documentation are highly encouraged.

The documentation lives in a dedicated folder within the repository (check the project for specific file paths). Use clear, simple language. Consistent formatting improves the overall experience. 

Feel free to fix typos, clarify descriptions, expand on missing areas or improve the overall user experience. It is expected that all new documentation aligns with the style guidelines. It improves the overall usability of the project. 

## Commit Message Guidelines ## 
Well-written commit messages enhance project history and collaboration by making it clear what the change is and why it was made.

Use consistent commit message formatting to ensure that commit logs are easily understandable. We encourage you to use a structured format like those described by the Conventional Commit specification to make the changes clear. It streamlines understanding.   

Each message should include a short summary followed by a more detailed explanation as needed in the subsequent lines of the body. The subject line should be no longer than 50 characters in length if possible.

## Branching Modeel ##

The team currently implements a Gitflow branching model to manage versioning and releases. The primary branches involved are `main `(production), `release `(stable), and `develop `(integrated development).

Feature branches are created from ` develop` when developing new features. Fix branches for urgent fixes are often branched from `release` and then cherry-picked or merged into all other relevant branches.

Follow a clear branch naming convention, such as `feature/add-login`  or `fix/typo-in-docs`. Branch names should accurately reflect the change being introduced. It helps to keep the codebase organized. 

 ## Review Process ##

After submitting a pull request, it will be reviewed by a maintainer. Feedback and requests for modifications are common during the review.

Be responsive to maintainers and address concerns as promptly as possible. The goal is a collaborative discussion to ensure changes align to the codebase standards, functionality, and overall project requirements and objectives.

Once the PR receives approval, maintainers will test changes and merge if all requirements are met. A release may be initiated to incorporate changes, which will be communicated to the community. 

## Communication Channels ##

For project-related communication, please use the official GitHub issues and the dedicated Slack channel. It is an ideal place to ask questions and discuss ideas.  

The issue tracker on GitHub will serve as the primary platform for reporting bugs, feature suggestions, and general discussions. The Slack group will provide a real time channel for quick and more informal conversation. 

## Security and Responsible Disclosure ##
We strongly encourage reporting security vulnerabilities responsibly and in a private manner to avoid potential harm or exploitation.

Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until a fix has been developed and verified, to avoid malicious use. If you have identified a security vulnerability that affects Stellaris, please contact a project maintainer directly via email. Please do not report on public forums. 

## Release Process ##

New versions of the Stellaris are typically released on a regular cadence.  Maintainers determine when releases occur based on the maturity of accumulated features and identified bug fixes.

Before a new release, maintainers will tag the ` main` branch using Git' s tagging feature. An appropriate chang log is updated with all relevant information on the released features.  Subsequently, the release is deployed to designated platforms.  

## Recognition ##

All contributors will be acknowledged in the `CONTRIBUTORS file`. Contributors who make substantial contributions will receive special recognition in the release notes.
