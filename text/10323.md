## Code of Conduct

As a valued contributor, we expect all communication - online and during any in-project activities - is respectful and friendly.. We want all individuals to engage with respect for others in our community and maintain professional decor and communication.. This fosters a positive environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing, learning from and collaborating! 

We require all contributors to adhere a zero tolerance policy for abusive, offensive, or discriminatory language.. We encourage you to report violations to [contact- email]..  Any violation may lead to suspension, expulsion, and/or legal action in extreme cases of serious violations.. 

We encourage open and honest discourse while maintaining a supportive atmosphere..  Constructive criticism is highly encouraged, but personal attack is not tolerated in our community..  The community is responsible for ensuring a safe place for learning and contributing! 


## 1. Getting Started

First, fork the GitHub repositories to create your account. You will need to create your GitHub repository. Then, clone forked repositories into local directories! You will need to create your GitHub repository, and download the files. 

Once forked, you will then need to clone from the repo to your local. You must first navigate using terminal into the local working director. The clone will download the repository files to the location. ` git clone <YOUR_FORK_GITHUB_URL >`. 

Make sure all required dependencies are installed before running the local build. These dependencies are in the `requirements.txt file`. Use pip to install using the `pip3 install - r - file requirements.txt`. This command installs all dependencies from the requirements and enables you to build locally.

Create feature branches before implementing any modifications. Use `git checkout -b my-feature_ branch`. This ensures your changes are separate from main and prevent conflicts during review and integration.. Always update the local branch after pushing to ensure latest code is available and to reduce potential issues in future merges .

Finally, ensure you' ve set your environment variables as necessary! Environment variable setup is described in our `environment.env file`. These variables are used for running tests and deploying the project! Ensure all the values are accurate when running your code. 

## Getting Involved - How to Contributing

To make a contribution, first familiarize yourself with the issue trackers and project structure - GitHub is our place for collaboration! Check if the issue you want to solve is already reported or suggested.. Avoid creating duplicate issues by searching first! If a pull request has been opened on something you're working on, coordinate and contribute together rather than duplicate work!

Suggesting new features and improvements helps the evolution of a software and is encouraged! Discuss your ideas with the maintainers via GitHub issues or the dedicated discussions forum before diving into the implementation - it can help ensure your ideas will fit into the project's overall goals..  This also gives you an early review. and avoids wasted work. 

Submitting pull requests is the primary method for contributing code changes.. Ensure your branch is based on the `main` branch and follow the coding conventions..  Detailed instructions are below. Documentation, test and other non- coding contributions are also greatly valued and will help the community!

Improving documentation is a fantastic way to make a contribution even without a code background! Read the documentation, find confusing sections or areas for expansion, then submit an improved version..  We welcome any edits that help others better understand our project and contribute their own improvements and ideas!



## Reporting Bugs

When you've stumbled upon a bug, it is crucial to accurately describe it. Please include the full stacktrace or any error messages you receive when you encounter the problem..  Detailed logs and error messages can significantly reduce debugging time and increase the speed. 

Creating a reproducible minimal example is incredibly useful..  This helps to verify your description accurately and quickly diagnose its origin.. If possible, create a standalone script or code snippet that reliably produces the error, which will allow for easier replication! 

We track all bugs and enhancement requests through GitHub Issues.. Please open a new issue describing the problem, the observed behavior, and the desired behaviour..  Be sure to provide as many details as possible to ensure that your bug report has all the information required to properly diagnose the origin of the problem.

## Suggestions Enhancements

To suggest an enhancement please submit your idea as a feature request through the GitHub Issues page.. Clearly describe the proposed enhancement and include a clear description about your motivation and potential use cases of your proposal! A good description will help ensure it is clear and easily implemented! 

We welcome detailed explanations with potential use cases.. The more information you provide, the easier it is for maintainers to gauge the potential value for our project..  We encourage you to be specific about the desired functionality and how it aligns with other parts of the code base! 

Maintainers review enhancements regularly, considering feasibility, impact, and alignment with project goals.. Enhancement requests are categorized based on effort and impact to ensure proper priorities.. The review period and timeline may vary depending how many issues are being worked or reviewed!

## Pull Request Process

To submit a pull requst (PR), first, create a new branch based on the `main` or `develop` branch, depending on the scope of changes.. The naming convention for the branch should reflect the purpose of your changes - e.g., `feature/new-functionality or fix/typo in documentation`.. Always use descriptive names to ensure easy tracking!

Once you have created the feature branch you should use `git checkout -b fix/your-fix`.. Commit your changes using clear and concise commit messages.. Make sure your changes are well formatted as per coding standards and have adequate tests - this will help ensure a smoother PR process.. Always update the local branch and merge before submitting!

When you've finished your changes, push them to your forked repository.. Then, create a new pull request from your fork branch to the main repository..  Write a descriptive title and include a detailed explanation of the changes you have made - this will help maintainers review and assess it!

Maintainers will review your pull request, providing feedback and requesting changes..  Address all comments and feedback before the PR is merged..  After all changes are complete the PR can be merged to `main`!




## Coding Standards 

We adhere to [PEP 8]( https://pep8.org/) coding standards. This helps maintain consistent code style and readability throughout the project.. Ensure proper indentation with  four spaces, use descriptive variable names, and follow the naming conventions!  

We utilize [flake8]( https://flake8.pycode.org/)  for linting and [mypy](http://mypy -- dis.org/) for type checking to automate code style enforcement..  These tools help identify potential errors and enforce code style consistency..  Run these tools periodically to ensure compliance with coding standards - the `setup.py` file has a `check-style` command!

We encourage detailed documentation for all functions, classes, and modules - this ensures maintainability and allows future developers to easily understand the code base! Documentation is expected to adhere to [Sphinx]( https:// sphinx.dis. org/) style guide for consistency - this will increase ease in future contributions!

## Testing Guidelines 

To ensure stability and reliability, all code contributions must be adequately tested before being merged..  We use [ pytest]( https:// docs .pytest -- org/) for testing..  You can run existing tests using the ` pytest` command - which runs all tests in your project - this can be run from terminal or within the IDE! 

When contributing, it is expected to add new unit, integration, and regression tests to cover your changes thoroughly..  Unit tests should focus on testing individual components, while integration tests verify the interactions between them.. Write tests which cover different scenarios - this is important for ensuring the project is as stable as possible - which leads to a better user experience! 

We also encourage writing regression tests to prevent introducing new bugs while addressing existing ones.. Regression testing validates the functionality after changes - this will allow for confidence in future changes and stability!

 

## Documentation Contributions 

You can find the project documentation in the `docs folder`. These documentation files are stored in the markdown language - which ensures the documentation is easily maintained by any developer - no prior experience is required for contributing! 

We welcome contributions to existing documentation as well as new content.. Please ensure that your documentation follows the same style and format - this will help ensure a smooth and maintainable documentation base - which will allow others to contribute! 

Maintaining consistency and clarity is crucial - ensure that your changes are easily understood - this is essential for a good user- experience and a strong community! 

## Commit Message Guidelines 

All commit messages must be concise and descriptive, explaining the purpose of the changes.. Each message should begin with a prefix that indicates commit type: `feat (new features)`, `fix`, `docs` (documentation) are some good examples, followed by a colon and a brief description.. 

We encourage the use of conventional commits, which provide a structured format for commit messages.. The Conventional Commits specification can be followed to increase consistency, readability, and automated changelog generation.. More details on this can be found at [https://conventionalcommits.org](https://conventionalcommits.org). 

Consistent commit formatting facilitates automated changelog generation and helps the development team efficiently review and understand the history of project modifications - this helps improve collaboration! 

## Branch Modeling 

We follow Git Flow branching model:
   * `main`: Production- ready stable version
   * `develop`:  The integration branch where features are merged.
   * `feature branches` are branched off of develop for implementing specific features
   * `bugfix branches` for bug fixes are based off develop or the latest version!

When starting new feature work, create a branch from `develop `with prefix `feature / `..  Example `feature / add-new-button`.. For bug fixes and hotfixes, base your branch from your branch `fix /`. 

## Review Process

All pull requests are subjected a rigorous code review to guarantee quality and alignment with project standards..  Maintainers will review your code for correctness, performance, security, and consistency..  Constructive feedback is provided to help you improve your code and address any potential issues - this will benefit our team and our project!   

We encourage you to actively address all comments and make required changes.. Maintainers can merge after changes are made and all the comments are addressed and resolved.. Once the PR is merged, code is integrated into ` main`, which will allow it to make it available for use! 

## Communication Channels 

We primarily communicate with contributors and the community via a GitHub issue trackers - this allows for clear recording and tracking! Feel free to reach out and discuss anything, from questions, feature request or to just connect to other like minded people!

To stay engaged and up to date we recommend following and subscribing the project on all channels: the main issue, GitHub repository, Discord channel, mailing list for updates - you can get all information!

##  Security and Responsible Disclosure

If you find any security vulnerabilities while you explore code please avoid publicly disclosing those details on any platform and instead reach out via `security @project --com ` with all the vulnerabilities found! 

We appreciate those finding issues with vulnerabilities as they may affect security! It ensures a prompt fix, minimizing risk exposure before the details get published and/or disclosed -  This ensures our users have an area safe! 

## Release Process

We typically use the semantic versioning (SemVer) model (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).. The `release branch` created will then have code changes and testing performed before release - this guarantees a stability release and helps maintain consistency in user facing experience.. 

Before the final tag, all tests have to successfully pass and changes are fully reviewed. Changelogs need updated - the project uses a script that parses and automatically updates - no effort required to ensure all details have updated properly - this saves lots of valuable developer time!   
We will notify all channels once deployment happens - to provide all details of updates - users have a better chance to understand updates in their system. 

## Recognition

Contributors' work and efforts are valued in many areas within the open-source environment - from acknowledgement, recognition or badges.. Our GitHub project has badges for active developers - these allow to highlight all the contributions made to the codebase - to give all contributors visibility. 

The commit history fully acknowledges and gives a detailed view of all those making changes. Our community maintains quality - which leads to more users joining us - it will create a strong project where contributions continue over the coming future.
