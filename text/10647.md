## Getting Started

Before embarking into the contribution journey we strongly suggest that you clone the project repository, to a local environment. To do so, open terminal and initiate a clone by providing the Git URL to the repository `git clone <repository URL>`. After successful cloning, move into the created project directory `cd <project directory>`.

Create a new and dedicated branch to avoid any interference. This practice ensures any modifications remain contained, preventing accidental integration. You can do this utilizing commands `git switch -c develop` to branch from main, or if a specific feature or bugfix is needed, use commands `git switch -c feature/<relevant-feature>` or ` git switch -c fix/<relevant-bug>`.

The first stage of building the software locally is to navigate to the root directory, locate the dependencies file (e.g. requirements.txt, package.json) which details all dependencies required by the project to be installed. Then, run installation commands to obtain them: `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all packages in a 'requirements.txt' file, or `npm install`, for a package manager ' npm '. This command retrieves necessary files required to start your coding experience!   

To start the server or build, consult the ' README ' file for specific project instructions - it will have relevant instructions.  Commonly commands are `python ./ manage.py run` to begin a python web framework,  or a command such as ` npm start `to trigger the start event for a javascript/ node framework to start and initiate the build. Please check for errors during the installation and execution, ensuring your environment is properly configured and ready to work with!   

Finally, familiarize yourself with existing code and documentation. This initial understanding is essential for a successful and meaningful contribution and will reduce potential friction and misunderstandings during the coding experience. 

## How to Contribute

We welcome all sorts of involvement from community members. If you've stumbled upon a bug, please report it in the issue tracker on this GitHub repository! Got a great thought for something new? Share it by making a suggestion, and help us prioritize. Submitting a pull request, even a relatively small one, will make a real impact - we welcome every contribution from every contributor! 

Even documentation is an essential and often overlooked contribution. A well-organized, clear and concise documentation can improve a project, and it allows newcomers to get familiar more rapidly - if you notice something that requires improvement, please don't be afraid to improve or update the project docs - we will be delighted. We appreciate everyone, regardless of skills/experience who wish to contribute, and welcome them to the community.

Before diving into code, we kindly request you to chat with the project maintainer. It's a good approach to ensure the contribution aligns within our goals while preventing potential duplication. It can prevent unnecessary work while ensuring that all the changes implemented will provide a value to the broader platform. A discussion beforehand is a sign you want to collaborate and work with the team!   

If you're proposing a feature, try to think about who will use it & why, providing concrete and specific use cases. The better the proposal the easier the maintainers can assess the value and align the work with the overall objectives. It can help maintainers understand the value to decide the priorities - it helps the community. 

## Reporting Bugs

Finding bugs is inevitable in any coding project - we value the community' effort in pointing bugs and helping us make our projects more robust. Before submitting a bug you need to check if a bug exists on the same category or topic. A thorough check will also help maintain a tidy and clean issue tracking and avoid any confusion to the maintainers.

To ensure quick bug fixing and a clear understanding, we require a reproducible minimal example of steps that can reliably cause the bug to appear. This will save time and help the developers to focus on finding a fix. The clearer your steps, the easier the bug will be to address in a timely manner.

When submitting a bug, please provide a detailed description with the steps required to reproduce it. The description should be clear, and concise - also include your environment specifics (OS, version, software) for a quicker response. Report the bug directly within the GitHub Issues, under the " Bugs " label, and be descriptive about it to allow a quicker fix.  

Also, be sure to include any relevant error messages, logs, and stack traces which may help identify where the problem originates. Providing all relevant information will accelerate the bug fixing and allow the community to resolve the issue in an expedited timeframe.  

## Suggesting Enhancements

We are all about growth and innovation - we always welcome suggestions about new features, functionality, or improvement that could boost the quality of this software platform, making use of the tools easier and smoother. To submit your improvement idea, please create a " Enhancement " issue, detailing your suggestion.  

In your enhancement, please clearly explain your motivation, describing the problem the feature addresses or opportunity it exploits to enhance the overall user experience/ functionality. This can assist the community to understand the value to decide the priorities - it helps the community. Also, please describe a possible use case, detailing a scenario to illustrate how the enhancement would be applied.

The maintainers review all enhancement requests, prioritizing based on feasibility and community interest, and aligning the enhancement within the larger strategic objectives of the project. The discussion may involve feedback on the enhancement, and potential changes to be made - please stay open minded and collaborate with the team.

## Pull Request Process

To make a change, you must fork this GitHub repository. This creates a separate copy where you can implement your improvements. After that, create a branch for your changes. The branch name should be concise, descriptive, and adhere to the convention `feature/<relevant-feature>` if the changes implement a new feature, or `bugfix/<description of the bug>` for a bug related changes.   

To begin submitting your code, use the `git push origin <branch-name>` command, to upload your code to a forked repository. Once you have committed your modifications, navigate to your forked repository, and generate a ' Pull Request ' from the newly created branch towards the `main ` of the original repo. This signals the project maintainers to begin review.

The pull requested will go under scrutiny, and comments/ suggestions on areas of code will be provided - please address the suggestions promptly and update the ' Pull Request ' with new modifications. Once approved, merge is executed, and the community can use this improved code.   

## Coding Standards

To maintain uniformity and readability, we adopt a set of coding conventions. Indentation should use 4 spaces and no tabs, for improved cross-platform compatibility. Consistent naming conventions are crucial, where public attributes begin with a capital letter, whereas internal and helper attributes should begin with either an underscore `_ ` or a lowercase letter.

We enforce linting and type checking to catch errors and promote best practices, and to help maintain a high-quality and well structured codebase. We use a pre-configured `. eslintrc ` and `. flake config ` file that will automatically check your code for potential violations. Ensure your code passes all tests, and conforms to the coding standard before submitting a pull request.

We also emphasize thorough code documentation and inline comments, to help future developers understand the codebase. All public functions and classes should have detailed JSDoc-style documentation to explain their purpose, input parameters, returned values, and exceptional conditions or behavior.

## Testing Guidelines

Testing is vital in software development, ensuring stability, robustness - we strongly encourage all developers to create tests that cover a wide set of scenarios & edge cases, including unit & integration. The existing tests can be run with ` npm test ` or ` pytest `. Please make sure all your code is thoroughly validated, and it doesn not fail the existing automated test suite.   

To add your own tests, follow these guidelines: Unit tests should isolate individual components, while integration tests should verify interactions between different modules or layers of the system. Regression test should be used to ensure that existing features still function correctly after changes are made; this will help to catch unexpected regressions, and preserve stability, and reliability.

We support several testing frameworks like `Jest`, `Mocha`, & `Pytest`. The framework that's currently in use is detailed in `package.json` ( or ` requirement.txt`). If a new test requires additional dependencies, add it to the project dependencies file and install it using the appropriate package manager.

 ## Documentation Contributions

A well written and well maintained documentation is a vital component of a good project, and a valuable asset for the community. The documentation is primarily hosted on the same GitHub repository in the ` docs ` folder, and is written in Markdown files. To add or modify documentation, clone or fork the repository, and make the changes in the ` docs `/Markdown file in a new feature branch - then submit this as a PR.

When editing documentation, strive for clarity, conciseness, and consistency, ensuring all edits comply with the established style guide for this document to avoid any ambiguity. Please update the index to reflect the added or edited documentation to make the information readily accessible for users, and maintain consistent formatting - it helps the community! 

## Commit Message Guidelines

To facilitate easier navigation for future developers & contributors, please adhere to a strict and standard convention when writing commit messages. Each commit message should concisely describe the change it implements in the following format: " Type(Scope): Description ".  

We encourage the adoption of **conventional commits**. The `type` must adhere to standards - ' feat' - denotes a new feature added. A fix for a bug, `fix`. A change or modification ` chore `, ' refactor ',  ' doc `, ` style ', test '. The "Scope" represents area in which changes happened in the project: e.g UI , core - etc...

Why does formatting your commit messages so strictly helps ? Standard formatted commits allow easier and efficient changelog creation. It can allow to quickly and effectively create versions for distribution with accurate descriptions - and will reduce maintenance effort down the line in time and budget, improving community contributions!

## Branching Model

We currently implement a standard `Gitflow`, a widely used, robust model where `main ` always holds production ready and released state of our projects - we branch to develop features off main - it allows stable production, but also rapid and agile developments in separate and parallel branches.
The primary and recommended approach is creating ` feature-branches `, when introducing something brand new. Bugfixes go on a branch, called a ` fix ` , so that the bug will quickly addressed on an existing release with minimum effort - never committing on a main and production release branches unless highly justified - this will help avoid breaking code and potential deployment problems.   
 
For more detailed information, we have additional information in articles & blogs about ' Gitflow ' model online - this helps in the understanding and proper management, and collaboration across the teams to achieve common, well managed and sustainable project outcomes - this model has stood up as reliable over years. 

## Review Process

Once a pull request is generated the community and core maintainers are going to be looking and scrutinizing changes to provide helpful insights for improvement, as needed - please don 't take suggestions or feedbacks in a defensive approach; view it from community-building point, aiming at achieving better software!

After code has passed review by core developers or experienced engineers from the team the PR might need to run additional tests. If those fail and require adjustments you may address these with a further commit in the original branch, after this - a new re-review cycle would occur and once all checks, reviews are done with a satisfactory level it is mergeable in 'main ` for everyone!   

 ## Communication Channels

Our communication happens within these primary communication avenues and communities! For urgent questions or bug-fixes feel free to engage on GitHub discussions, within Issues - where it 's easy to track conversation history in organized, structured context! We maintain active Discord channels where users share tips & ideas or help others to troubleshoot, for faster real time communication!

Our email address is also used by the team and we will attempt responding within business hours for important requests and queries that might require in depth answers. To help avoid unnecessary messages please review GitHub discussion threads - there could have been previous responses or discussions related with the topic - please search and consult those discussions and threads!    

## Security and Responsible Disclosure

Our software aims to ensure data security for every end user without fail! We value community feedback - if you've encountered possible or suspected security risks and issues - don`t hesitate reaching us immediately via security.  (Email Address Here!)   
We ask contributors that all vulnerabilities & concerns regarding security are handled responsibly with a private communication rather a disclosure publicly, as we work quickly with a team dedicated in patching issues in time for a more secure and sustainable ecosystem of projects for everybody !  

## Release Process

When we prepare to deliver versions to customers & stakeholders we will use standard release cycles with clear communication, for transparency - new software release are marked by Git Tag and are incremented based upon SemVer standards: major - minor- and patch - we follow best release practice - it helps ensure a smoother cadence, for a well understood, consistent delivery of robust features.
We increment minor or major when a set of feature releases are deployed - patches for small bugs are done more routinely. All updates & changes made for release versions go inside the Changelog - and keep track with all new feature or fixes. 

## Recognition

Contributions play a very important role for the project - it would only thrive because you and all your colleagues and partners - it 's a shared, team achievement that builds and shapes up what our software does for end-users & community as a whole!  For every pull-requested accepted into the ' Main ` , the names and/ contributors who made that PR are added as credits in our ` CONTRIBUTERS `.

Also we would add names to the CHANGELOG - it will acknowledge those whose code will have significant impacts - and we value this acknowledgement, which fosters community and collaborative culture.  
 ## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before contributing substantial modifications & features, all new developers and community users might require you fill-out a `CLA` which is required legally, for ensuring the project can freely share/ reuse/ and redistribute changes made , within legal compliance! It protects everyone and is an effort from community for the community ! You may read the agreement here, & complete all required sections and return signed:
 (CLA - Legal link/ address here!)
