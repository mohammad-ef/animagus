## 3. Getting Started

To get started, it helps to set up the environment. First and foremost, it' the best to familiarize ourselves with our repo on the cloud, typically using GitHub (e g, forking, creating an accout if you do not have one). Clone down the relevant repository, so you have the files to work with. 

Once it is downloaded onto your machine, you' will likely want to install any needed prerequisites. Typically the `INSTALL.md file`, which should be included in the repo, provides details regarding dependencies such as Python, Javascript and required libraries. Please read through the file before continuing.  

Branching rules are crucial. When you have forked and cloned your own copy of the repository, create separate local branches for individual features or bug fixes. Name the branches following a convention such as: feature/new-feature, fix/bugfix and docs/documentation updates. Do not work directly on main.

Next, build the software using the project setup instructions.  This may mean executing the `npm install` (for frontend) or `setup.py install` ( for backends) commands, which installs all the required dependencies. The specific installation and build processes will vary depending on the codebase, so it' important to follow any provided instructions precisely.

## 4. How to Contribute

There are many ways to get involved!  We appreciate any help improving the project, regardless of expertise. You might find yourself fixing bugs, adding new features, or helping with documentation and providing guidance, and we would appreciate any assistance that can get us closer together. 

We also encourage you to submit suggestions for new features and improvements to enhance the user experience, expand functionality or add support, as well improving testing coverage across the project, and making documentation accessible across the community as well. We are always looking for feedback, and new ideas and directions.

Before starting a significant implementation, consider discussing the changes with other contributors. This will help identify potential pitfalls, and also align the changes with the goals and direction of project. Creating a new issue or engaging in discussion threads on the project's communication channels, like Discord and Slack, may prove effective.    

We welcome improvements to the documentation as much as we do bug fixes, so feel free submit any improvements you deem to be relevant for improving clarity and understanding across the ecosystem of our software and users. We are also always open to suggestions from our users, and the best way is to file a suggestion as a GitHub discussion.   

To report an issue, go to the "Issues" page within your forked repo and submit a detailed report describing the bug. For new features, open a "Feature Request" issue, providing as much information as possible. To create documentation, edit the existing documentation.   

 

   

## 5. Reporting Bugs

When submitting a new issue, please make your report as descriptive as possible, with a detailed explanation, and a link to GitHub if applicable, to provide context. It is best to provide a detailed, reproducible, clear, and step-by-step instructions.

A clear title is also a key component of your issue, and it should concisely describe the bug in an easily identifiable, clear language that can be quickly and directly read. Please ensure you are providing as much detail as necessary, which should allow our team to fully understand the scope of issues and resolve them quickly.

When reporting a bug, ensure you are checking that the issue has not yet been raised by a contributor before submitting a new issue. A thorough check of the issue tracker on the repository can help eliminate duplicates.

Finally, to aid the reproduction of the issue, consider adding a log file, if applicable for your specific case. A log provides valuable debugging information that can assist the developers in resolving the issue, as it can often highlight specific areas for further investigation as a starting point.    

## <font color="red "> **All issues and documentation must contain a title to be properly addressed** 

<hr color="blue ">
## 6. Suggesting Enhancements

We are committed to the continuous improvement of the Acme Project, and we welcome ideas for new features and enhancements. To submit a well-formed and well-considered enhancement request:

First, open a new "Feature Request" issue, providing a clear, succinct, and comprehensive explanation of the enhancement, its intended purpose, and potential user benefits. Please provide a detailed explanation, including any potential use cases for this functionality.    

Second, consider including a mock-up, diagrams, or any other visual aids that can help illustrate the idea and facilitate a common understanding with the rest of the contributors and core team. This can be a useful way for developers to grasp the concept.

Our maintainers carefully review all feature requests, considering their alignment with project goals, feasibility, and potential for broad user adoption before moving them into the pipeline for prioritization or implementation.  We' will provide updates on their progress within a reasonable timeframe, keeping our users and community apprised.    

Finally, remember, all enhancements must adhere to existing guidelines, so it is critical to align with project standards, so the integration will prove seamless and consistent with the existing code, and architecture.  

## <font color="red "> **Feature suggestions must include a detailed description, potential use cases, and mockups** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 7. Pull Request Process

To submit a pull request, make sure you have branched using:
 ```bash
 git checkout - b feature/branch-name
  ```
Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages. After committing, push the code from your feature branch to the fork.

Next, create a new pull request from your fork's branch to the Acme main or development branch. Write a detailed pull request description, outlining the intended functionality, the changes made, and any potential impact on existing features or the broader ecosystem.

Our maintain team reviews each PR thoroughly for style, functionality, and adherence to the established standards. They may provide feedback to improve the solution or identify potential issues. Please be receptive to their feedback, addressing issues and iterating on your code as necessary, so the integration will prove seamless and consistent with the existing ecosystem.

Following a successful review, including automated testing, the PR will be merged into the project, incorporating its contributions and extending its reach within the larger Acme universe to the wider world.     

## <font color="red "> **PRs must be merged following code and testing review from all stakeholders**     

<hr color="blue ">

## 8. Coding Standards

We adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for Python, and the Google JavaScript Style Guide for JavaScript. These standards promote code readability and consistency, and contribute to a maintainable base of code. We encourage the use of code linters (flake8 for Python and ESLint for JavaScript) that ensure code follows the established guidelines.

To ensure consistency, we use pre-commit hooks to automatically check for formatting, linting, and type checking before a change is committed. This reduces the risk of introducing code that does not meet style requirements and helps maintain a high-quality base of code.   

We require detailed documentation for all functions, classes, and modules, ensuring that the code is easily understandable by both developers and end-users alike. Documentation should be accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date to facilitate collaboration, and ensure code longevity and maintainability.      

We encourage contributors to use a consistent naming convention, and to avoid abbreviations and acronyms. Code should strive to be expressive and easy to understand, and avoid overly complicated or abstract logic that may hinder understanding across all contributors and users alike.  

## <font color = "red "> **Code must be PEP 8- compliant, using a pre- commit system that runs automatically before committing new content** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 9. Testing Guidelines

Thorough testing helps to guarantee the reliability, functionality, and stability of the Acme Project, enabling users to trust in our solutions and confidently integrate their software into the Acme Project ecosystem.   

To start, make sure existing tests are run before submitting a pull request. This can be done by executing the `pytest` (for Python) or `jest` (for JavaScript) commands, as defined in the relevant setup file, to ensure no regression is created.

We utilize a combination of unit, integration and regression tests across all areas of the project. Write new tests when submitting a PR, especially when new functionality is implemented or when a bug is fixed, to help prevent regression and increase stability.   

We expect tests to be well-written, readable, and comprehensive, to cover all the necessary functionality and edge- cases. All tests should be automated, meaning the tests must run without manual intervention, which facilitates continuous and reliable testing, and ensures quality across the entire project as a whole.      

We welcome the use of any testing frameworks, but it's best to adhere to the existing, widely recognized, frameworks, and tools, such as pytest, Jest, and similar frameworks to facilitate ease of contribution, and seamless maintenance.   

## <font color = "blue "> **All tests are automated, and well documented, following established frameworks** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 10. Documentation Contributions

To update or improve documentation, edit the relevant Markdown files ( `.md`) located under the `docs` folder within the repository, ensuring that all edits comply with the established style. The style guide will be outlined as part of these documents.  

When creating new documentation pages, or making major edits to existing documentation, please create an additional PR, specifically targeted for the Documentation team to approve as necessary to maintain high standards across the board, across both contributors and the end-user alike.   

To enhance maintainability, ensure any modifications maintain clear organization and readability across all contributing areas to improve accessibility to information across all audiences alike.   

Finally, we welcome improvements in the structure of existing files in documentation or suggestions that will enhance clarity. Any new documents, diagrams or examples should conform to our guidelines so there won\'t be issues later during integration and adoption to improve quality over the lifecycle of this system.     

## <font color="blue "> **Document changes must adhere to guidelines to ensure readability and accessibility.**   

<hr color="blue ">

## 11. Commit Message Guidelines

Clear and descriptive commit messages enhance traceability and collaboration across project stakeholders; a good one provides essential information on what happened, when, and how and adds a great degree of visibility across contributors in the code lifecycle and management phases.     

Commit messages should adhere to the conventional commits standard, following a concise title of at most 50 characters followed by a space, followed by a descriptive body if needed to describe a complex feature implementation in sufficient details to enable others in understanding what changes were deployed to resolve.

Prefix your commit messages with an appropriate type: `feat` for new features, `fix` for bug fixes, `docs` for documentation updates, `style` for formatting, `refactor` for code refactoring, `test` for test additions, or `chore` for build process changes or maintenance. The conventional commiits system allows easy integration in automation, tooling, and version tracking processes for seamless release management for a greater efficiency and productivity as we scale across the community

The use of concise messages improves collaboration. It facilitates efficient communication of intent for other developers who might potentially contribute. By ensuring everyone's code changes and updates follow these guidelines.    

Always write commit messages in the imperative mood - for example:  'Fix issue #42" rather than "Fixed issue #42"   to promote an efficient, simplified code flow and communication.     

## <font color="blue "> **All code submissions follow conventions for descriptive content for clarity. All PR and releases use conventional format to enhance efficiency. ** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 12. Branching Model

Our primary goal to keep `main`, the most current branch with the stable production state; as this is the most rigidly monitored code available at any stage in production for release cycles, this is an integral step towards our mission in its stability.

Each branch for any work will have names starting from prefixes that specify functionality; typically prefixed like  `feature`,  `fix`,`doc`, and so on; the prefix should always describe work in that branch. The prefix can be a short and clear name, and must never cause conflicts across the ecosystem or team of stakeholders working to maintain this ecosystem

Branching must only happen directly from either `main` for small, minor adjustments that can happen without impacting core workflows, and/or `develop` (a development version), as these are primary branches, to minimize disruption across core functionality, and allow a clear distinction to be created and maintained for any code in transit or for review before ultimately integrating the change and publishing or deployment into a new release.      

## <font color="blue "> **Always create your PR and changes using our designated naming format. Without it will result in automatic reject to keep code quality across stakeholders.**   

<hr color="blue ">

## 13. Review Process

Maintainers thoroughly evaluate the pull requests (PRs) that come from contributors for adherence to established guidelines; this ensures the codebase adheres to those requirements for the entire scope of code across contributors as well the entire approach of stakeholders, which ensures a high overall degree of success and stability across teams

The issue is evaluated to make certain changes conform to existing coding guidelines. Maintainers might make specific changes that can be added in, if there were errors. They are welcome to be made. Please accept those feedback with the mindset for a shared outcome and vision for code that meets quality metrics of stakeholders

PR are approved and accepted only if changes are aligned, tested for correctness, tested on the relevant testing framework (i.e unit/test frameworks that align with your specific submission. The goal here, however, should still be to maintain code that's readable, efficient, maintainable in accordance with industry practices, so this review is designed in line to promote the benefits

## <font color="blue "> **Review Process will ensure changes will be integrated with all the necessary checks, to ensure stability, correctness. Maintain quality compliance ** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 14. Communication Channels

If any contributors or stakeholders have concerns with this project. or with their work or with code submissions from any other individuals in general. We encourage everyone on team/ stakeholders across the entire code, that the first place to seek assistance to inquire from any one or many team/ stakeholders who would know or could potentially address concerns.

Discussions, suggestions need be made using the GitHub issues page available, with a clear explanation to make issues easily identifiable as the scope of discussion grows as we build towards resolution across contributors or maintainers.

Additionally we provide access, where feasible through our project documentation pages for additional assistance to facilitate collaboration across contributors and ensure quality code. It is also recommended, in case issues are of urgency that can impact production and require prompt action; to directly address a project owner through communication channel listings for rapid support across a large community and scale as it develops into its own lifecycle and growth trajectory over long-run. 

## <font color="blue "> **Please use these platforms and methods maintain an active community** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 15. Security and Responsible Disclosure

When it is found security bugs and/ or concerns with a system/ codebase in place to mitigate risk from the environment it sits and/or to improve code. It must follow responsible procedures that align across security, governance frameworks for security compliance to keep stakeholders in safe environment.    

Security flaws and/ vulnerabilities, should only disclosed to designated project owners to provide a time for developers fix before publishing it for all to understand or for potential exposure that would impact a broader set stakeholders. 

We will appreciate and thank those that take responsible measures to protect the ecosystem from external harm as part of this process of community ownership.   Please use GitHub secure disclosures channels, where appropriate as an additional safeguard for protection from any bad actor to help protect all.       

## <font color="blue "> **Protect community stakeholders with secure disclosure through channels.**

<hr color="blue ">

## 16. Release Process

To manage releases of code across the community in production to end-user. Our team adheres semantic versioning of 3 digit numbering scheme of `[Major-Version]. [Minor-Version]. [BuildVersion]`. It provides clear guidance to stakeholders on compatibility changes in a version across different code and versions in place and allows stakeholders to make decisions that meet the overall goal with the product

New releases typically occur every 30-days, or more depending, to maximize adoption, and reduce impact and risk from external forces, with an introductory version.  Versioning will occur using `Tag-Release Version` which allows version control in code.   This process allows all users and maintainers easily keep in lock-step of releases

We appreciate contributors that are well familiar with code, testing framework. It adheres semantic release as the goal. We also provide guidance to stakeholders, so that there will be smooth transitions in releases for all to keep code and product lifecycle aligned for future releases as we scale the code and its adoption across larger audiences over a larger span in long-run  

## <font color="blue "> **Adhering release management is crucial as a standard across teams to maximize opportunities and benefits across product as the project matures ** 
   
<hr color="blue ">

## 17. Recognition

Project and team will provide contributors to receive acknowledgement or to give public-acknowledgment. The project has its own public recognition page that will recognize individuals. Additionally a public-listing of those individuals who contributed in our changelog. 

To promote community, it also important stakeholders take initiative on keeping standards of quality to meet level and maintain standards across project contributors and code that we all work in unison with shared-goals as an aligned and focused unit across a team with aligned purpose, to meet shared mission as community of people, towards success.   

This ensures code remains well aligned. This allows a more consistent product while scaling across the project.   Thank You, 
    
## <font color="blue "> **Recognize community members who work diligently, as a part of overall project. A great and shared community. A collaborative and successful environment across all.**

<hr color="blue ">

## 18. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This project adheres strict governance standards to provide all rights of usage across code. It requires individuals, stakeholders across teams. To agree that any submissions they make, are free from licensing concerns as it can scale well as a business with the overall community across stakeholders and contributors as part the ecosystem of project as part the code

The Contributor License Agreement provides an easy and simple approach of allowing ownership release as it allows contributors and teams to focus efforts to build, create, enhance product without licensing restrictions to maximize potential opportunities across teams

All submissions need agree, and adhere by license agreements that is published to enable seamless release of project into larger audiences for adoption with shared code ownership and community governance

## <font color="blue "> **All individuals that want code to become a product or to contribute in code must be willing and sign agreement for the benefit, and protection, and security and focus that can improvement product lifecycle as it scales across broader audiences in a shared ecosystem across larger communities as an entity **
