# CONTRIBUTING#
  
 Welcome! We are glad we are glad that you're interested in contributing to this project. Contributions, whether technical or otherwise, are vital as the foundation on which we continue to grow and build upon our project' s success. We value any effort that helps us to make our project more efficient or better for the wider public!

  We encourage contributions from community developers with varied experience, and appreciate everyone taking time to engage with our project. No effort is too small. Your feedback, insights from using our project, or bug fixes contribute directly to a stronger overall product. 

  This guide outlines the procedures you will need while participating in our community. It aims to make contributing as streamlined and easy to understand possible, and we are grateful for the effort you dedicate to our project.

## Code of Conduct

  We are committed to foster a warm, safe, and friendly community for everyone. We value all contributors, and we expect everyone to interact respectfully and constructively. Please be mindful of your words and conduct to ensure a welcoming environment for all participants. 

  This means being respectful of differing opinions, refraining from personal attacks, and actively seeking to understand alternative viewpoints.  Constructive criticism is welcome, but delivered with empathy and professionalism. Harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior will not be tolerated and may lead to a ban from the community.

  To ensure a positive and inclusive experience for all, we adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). You are expected to review and abide by this code. Violations will result in removal from project involvement and possible notification to appropriate authorities if the behavior constitutes illegal actions.

## Getting Started

 First, ensure you have the necessary tools: Git is mandatory for version control, and a suitable programming language environment (as specified in our README) is crucial for local development and debugging purposes. Make it a priority to have the correct versions and packages installed.  

Next to begin, fork the repository on GitHub. This creates a copy of our repository to you where you can test code without influencing the official product directly. Clone your forked repository locally to begin work on our project's features and code on your computer! Use this `git clone <your_fork_url>` command in your command prompt/terminal.

After the repository has downloaded and installed to your PC, navigate into your newly-downloaded files using the terminal `cd <your_repository>`.  To set up the working environment it will typically entail installing required packages using `npm install` or equivalent based on your programming environment to enable our product!  This can vary so please refer to our Readme on instructions that align with our coding practices!

Create a new branch in your local repository for your work. Avoid working directly on the `main` branch because your code must not interfere with current releases while undergoing improvements! A well-formatted branch like `feature/<your-feature-name>` provides context to maintainers regarding its purpose.

## How to Contribute

 We happily receive all kinds of contributions to make this project better! This ranges from submitting small fixes and reporting problems with functionality, suggesting ideas, contributing better or improved coding, improving or fixing documents. Your input has an effect no matter the magnitude!

 You are more than welcome to suggest improvements in areas such as our project, and to reach out and share any thoughts and opinions on where improvements should occur to better improve project development for a broader audience. Please reach out on any concerns to allow our product's team the change to review any thoughts, concerns or opinions to enhance product experience!

Submitting pull requests can enhance our products, so please follow our guidelines.  Read them to the letter to guarantee it meets project specifications for merging and implementation to enhance overall development! This will also involve ensuring all the required steps, such as running all automated procedures before committing the final code for approval by the development team.

 Improving our project also goes beyond only technical coding practices and includes updating documentation as this improves usability for the end consumer or anyone else interacting with the system for a smoother, effective user-journey! Please contribute your ideas in our designated area to better streamline user engagement, as a more comprehensive project leads to increased engagement and product usability.

## Reporting Bugs

 Please first search through existing issues on our GitHub repository to confirm that it doesn\'t occur to others as well to help avoid duplication! Be very sure it does not, if it has happened, you may be able to follow-up by contributing a fix or solution to enhance existing issues for others experiencing similar bugs/issues.

To submit a clear bug report, provide comprehensive information regarding when/how you found it occurring with details on system environments you tested and the specific error codes you experienced as well. Include, in detail, all necessary information and reasons on which led to experiencing this. This makes our debugging process significantly much quicker to help address your needs efficiently.

A **reproducible example** is key to efficiently resolving the problem. A clear demonstration on a minimum, repeatable instance will dramatically improve efficiency in reproducing, identifying the origin and fixing this quickly! Shortcode examples are always preferable!  Share these details to allow maintainers and community members alike a clear path for reproducing issues effectively!  Submit all your observations through our GitHub issue tracker at [https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo>/issues](https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo>/issues).

## Suggesting Enhancements

 Have a groundbreaking idea? Share it with us through the project\'s discussion forum or a dedicated suggestions channel to allow for discussion, evaluation, and alignment across contributors.  A comprehensive and clear explanation will significantly impact maintainer evaluation of new features or potential implementations to improve usability or performance of an ongoing release!

 Please describe in clear detail how the proposed enhancement solves the problem or addresses a need within a real use case or specific context, along with outlining possible alternative implementation solutions if relevant or needed. We take the effort from contributors like you, very seriously. 

We assess these submissions considering several factors: alignment with project goals, effort involved in implementation, potential impact on the user base, and feasibility considering existing architectural choices and project dependencies! Maintainers are happy to answer all concerns on how your submission can align better or provide a different scope on how you want the feature/improvement implemented, or what mechanisms we need in order to incorporate!

## Pull Request Process

 Create a new branch for **every feature** you contribute with `git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>`. Please be clear on naming branches and feature titles! Keep your feature focused in terms of the change it makes and be consistent across multiple PR releases or submissions as consistency leads to a higher-level of organization in future code releases.

 Before committing a Pull Request ensure there is relevant unit testing or documentation in-line or associated that supports changes. If a Pull Request fails our automated system please review your logs for any warnings as that is your best clue for fixing this and submitting another version until approved. 

  All contributions undergo detailed reviews and quality assessment by team lead and team mentors and are tested against current builds for regression, integration issues and potential performance implications before merge is allowed, please allow 1-2 weeks to address all the concerns or potential roadblocks. Merged branches become available in our main codebase upon release cycles to provide users/contributors an active and ongoing update cycle!

## Coding Standards

 Adherence to established style guides (like PEP 8 for Python) promotes code consistency and readability, reducing maintenance complexity for contributors or programmers working on similar projects in a shared code ecosystem!  Use appropriate code documentation in your files to help maintain the integrity, and understandability and overall accessibility for the community.

 Our projects are set up to include code formatters as pre-commit or linters that check syntax. This contributes toward automating coding checks to improve the code and catch common coding-related problems. We strongly enforce using linters for any submitted contribution so our coding is standardized to reduce maintenance overheads and overall coding consistency

 Ensure the naming convention for the project variables, classes, function parameters adheres strictly and are well defined to prevent future ambiguities when debugging or collaborating, so it is easily recognizable when someone encounters code for our shared products, our project must adhere to clear code practices across every single contributor and release for consistent development across multiple releases.

## Testing Guidelines

 Please write automated tests, especially unit tests covering individual units and/or modules in addition to functional and end-to-end or regression test, and ensure they cover as much code functionality in your PR release for the best results when merged and implemented for wider community releases. Our project has a dedicated testing directory that should host these, for easy reference.

 To run these please refer to specific framework setup in your environment that our repository provides, which includes dependencies such as `pytest`, `jasmine`, and many frameworks depending on programming requirements of current product builds, which is available to the developer community to improve our ongoing project releases for broader usage in future! We have automated build systems in addition, so these automated builds are triggered automatically for new builds/submits on the project!

We highly promote creating test documentation on your test suites in addition as this is an additional aid during integration of test-releases in current or near future versions and allows us better insight into what tests we require or do not in addition when developing new feature implementations! Our commit system tracks and provides visibility of tests run as part of builds for easy visibility on quality assessment metrics.

## Documentation Contributions

 Our documentation repository stores documentation related content which include project documentation as tutorials or developer-level documents to help developers contribute. To edit, update existing and provide a smoother user interface and journey we encourage everyone to improve it by adding more details on features, or update it.  If it should not exist yet then contribute!

When making updates adhere strictly to documentation guidelines. Consistency, accurate formatting as per style conventions as provided by style and formatting conventions in documentation. We use markdown in the repo and it can be easily rendered.

  If any questions or uncertainties please do let us know and feel free to create discussions with the core project to help streamline and standardize your changes! 

## Commit Message Guidelines

 To streamline review workflows ensure each contribution adheres strictly to clear and meaningful, commit description and messaging. It makes review process quicker by summarizing code change, reason as per implementation details of what's occurring and helps the reviewer better understanding changes for approvals.  Please adhere strictly.

  Adopt conventional commits. The commit type must align, so a feature is prefaced by "feat:" for example while fix is "fix:" so the system automatically tracks feature releases! Use this style and ensure your message includes description with a brief overview for context for maintainability! It's an industry best practice so follow!

 Clean descriptive message matters as code can easily undergo multiple iterations or versions, making it easy and clear on reviewing our history to understand context! Clear descriptions are a key factor, especially during merge/review as the commit system will allow for efficient code merging and understanding during future versions and debugging integrations as well!

## Branching Model

 This project implements Gitflow. The 'main' branch represents stable releases with tags marking each point as well with the specific versions and changes included to the code releases for tracking! Development efforts take place upon feature/hotfix and/or development branches to ensure main stays up to standard for production releases

 To create an ongoing work-effort please checkout from the `develop` or feature/ branch as these will serve to track the evolution as new functionality, code improvements as new builds get implemented. The goal remains to maintain `main` up to stable code for production releases for wider consumption!

  Branch naming is very strict - feature branches are in format 'feature/<branch name>'; similarly with "hotfix"/"release branches' for emergency bug and releases fixes respectively; it is vital and must adhere to convention! Please adhere and ensure the project's code stays aligned as it evolves through ongoing implementations, fixes or bug updates across contributing team!

## Review Process

 Maintainers thoroughly reviews each submitted PR by reviewing, checking the implementation details, code style/formatting standards, ensuring tests run as well, and no regressions occur when changes are introduced, which can cause problems with production.  Be receptive of any critiques from our maintainers.

 Expect timely responses within our review timeline to questions/issues to enable the maintenance cycle being as efficient as possible for everyone's involvement, so please address concerns promptly.  Maintainers have the authority and decision over the implementation of any code that goes through and it needs approval to be integrated into the product!

  Post successful implementation all merged commits get reflected on main branch upon a standard release/implementation build cycle!

## Communication Channels

 To discuss or report concerns regarding this code directly we can communicate and exchange feedback over [Project GitHub issue-tracking forum](https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo>/issues). It serves central hub where we address any concerns for transparency to all. 

 If you require a quicker exchange feel free to participate through the Discord channels: [Join Discord Chat!](https://discord.gg/examplechannel)!

 For more professional and critical concerns we will address those via [mailing list/support](mailto:support@example.com) where you have a better ability for addressing any serious problems/ concerns with greater attention to resolution to address! 

## Security and Responsible Disclosure

 To help prevent exploitation vulnerabilities or any issues impacting security, all security flaws or problems MUST BE DISCLOSED in confidence and should **NEVER** posted to our issue trackers as this may result in exposure of security exploits to the general population easily accessible, causing issues to the product itself.

Please reach out immediately, as quickly as possible, using our secure channels for vulnerability disclosures [vulnerabilityreport@example.com] and describe as detailed possible on impact and the steps taken. This gives a window period, usually of one-to-two weeks before any information public to ensure we fix and mitigate all the vulnerabilities effectively and quickly to protect end-users/customers!

We are dedicated and grateful in receiving security-sensitive contributions for the community. We will always prioritize public safety as the foremost goal to provide security-focused and responsible reporting and disclosure as our highest goal as we move our code and product!

## Release Process

  When code gets implemented we have automated scripts as builds which will generate build versions that include automated code quality testing/integration tests that occur automatically for quality assurance. All these tests need to succeed. These versions get pushed as standard builds, with tag names as well.

 To update and prepare the release you should review any documentation changes in changelogs as it reflects all significant contributions to help consumers better grasp all changes/updates made as well during implementation as part of releases! Semantic versioning as best practice, helps ensure the product has good visibility for users to understand changes made during builds for a transparent user experience as it helps users stay aware of product changes in our community efforts!

 Once a stable and tested branch has all the tests completed we prepare our release builds which can be found at [release repository!](https://<releaselink/releasetag>)! We aim for regular builds so everyone gets a chance at the newest features for the project, for better product usability.

## Recognition
