# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions of any kind are welcomed, regardless of experience level! We believe that a strong community builds a stronger project. Your contributions can range from fixing typos in documentation to tackling major features - all valuable and much appreciated.

This project relies on community contributions to stay current, robust, and user-friendly for everyone. Every bug fixed, test written, or enhancement proposed makes a difference and directly supports our users and goals. Join us in making this a great software!

We encourage both technical and non-technical contributions.  Good design decisions, clear explanations, and thoughtful discussion all help shape the best possible outcomes. Let' focus all contributions on being collaborative and constructive in order to benefit everyone.

 ## 1. Code of Conduct

We are a supportive, respectful, inclusive community. Every participant, regardless of skillset, ethnicity, gender, identity, or anything else, has the right to a positive and collaborative experience here.

Harassment, bullying, or any kind of disrespectful behavior is not tolerated. We want everyone to feel comfortable contributing without fear of judgment or discrimination. Please adhere to our values to ensure a safe place to build software with all.

If you experience or see something that is not aligned with our Code of Conduct, please report it. The issue should be addressed by maintain contributors. The project maintains the authority to immediately exclude anyone whose behavior is considered disruptive and/or disrespectful to the team.

## 2. Getting Started

First, you'll obviously need a GitHub account. If that's covered, please fork the repository to your GitHub account. Cloning your for into your workspace and set up is the following steps.

Next, make sure you have the prerequisites installed: a suitable environment, such as Python 3.  You may also need Node or a version of Java for specific build steps depending on the technology. Make sure your tool versions match the requirements defined in the project's `requirements.txt` or similar file.

Once you've cloned the repository to your local machine, run `npm install` within the directory to manage dependencies.  The build instructions (e g. `make`, `gradle build`, or similar commands) is found in `README.md` and/or associated build system documentation.

Create a new branch for your changes.  It is critical to branch off of the `main `(or sometimes `develop `) to isolate your changes. Use a descriptive branch name like `fix/typo-in-readme` or  `feature/add-search-functionality`.

Finally, after you make changes in branch, run a `git pull origin main` (or develop) to ensure you are up-to-date before beginning your local changes.

## 3. How to Contribute

We welcome many ways you can help with this project.  From fixing typos to contributing significant new features, all contributions are appreciated.

Reporting issues is the easiest first step. Clear and concise bug reports, feature requests or improvement requests helps us quickly understand and prioritize the tasks at hand. Please read the section " Reporting Bugs " below. 

Suggesting new enhancements is also a great contribution. If you find something that could make the project better, don’t hesitate to submit a suggestion. Read the section " Suggesstions for Enhancements". We encourage discussions before starting large features to prevent wasted effort.

Improving documentation is a vital and often overlooked contribution. Even a spelling correction in our user guides benefits users in ways the developer never expects.  See below to get familiar with documenting our codebase. 

## 4. Reporting Bugs

When you encounter a bug, it really is invaluable to us! However, effective bug reporting is critical for a timely and complete solution. Be descriptive with each step that leads to an undesired behavior. 

When submitting an issue on GitHub, please provide:
* **Environment Details:** OS, versions of related tools (Python, node.js, etc.).
* **Steps to Reproduce:** Clear and precise, step-by-step.
* **Expected Result:** What should have happened.
* **Actual Result:** What happened instead.
* **Stack Trace (if applicable):** Helps pinpoint the code location of an issue.

The easiest approach is to isolate your bug with code in order to be reproducable, or a series of clear reproduction steps that we can test and debug. This greatly simplifies resolving problems, thanks!

## 5. Suggesting Enhancements

Got a great idea for a new feature or improvement? Wonderful! Sharing these helps ensure the software will meet user goals in all aspects. Before jumping to a submission however, let explore existing functionality or feature to verify that your enhancement won not break the functionality of something current.

We desire clear motivations along with your suggestion and explain your vision. Provide specific use cases and a justification to illustrate why the feature would be useful or address current shortcoming of software. We can discuss the impact of each suggestion, so be sure you outline any impact or dependencies with other aspects of code. Ensure it aligns with our vision for project's purpose and target audiences.

Reviewers consider a feature based on effort (estimated developer time), the benefits to current use and the degree that addresses a need for user groups or target demographic groups. We want you, along with us, to have this in mind as it is critical that it will meet a use.

## 6. Pull Request Process

Before working on large or substantial enhancements: submit the needs of your code for discussion before implementation, or it might lead to wasted developer work time! 

Follow these guidelines: 
1. Create a new branch (feature/name_of_feature or fix/description). Use short descriptions in names!
2. Write meaningful, short commit messages, referencing conventions. (see section " Commit Message Guidelines ").
3. Implement your changes with the goal that it works! Write and update testing code so your code can survive. 
4. Create a pull request, linking back to an open GitHub issue or adding a clear, well formatted description of changes
5. Reviewers give thoughtful feedback - take that and deal! 
6. After all checks are satisfied merge in pull requests with the code base.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Added new search functionality"
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

## 7. Coding Standards

Maintaining consistent coding style helps the project look clean, improves collaboration, and simplifies future maintenance. This makes for happier developers, better maintainability of code!

This projects use the Google Python Style Guide (or applicable standards to other supported programming languages), which emphasizes readability, consistency and clear logic over all concerns.  This ensures our users get code to rely on for future.

Automated code quality checking and linting should always run to verify standards are adhered to with each contribution, as this can easily be overlooked with manual reviews alone. Tools and their settings can vary depending on your local system but the goal should always adhere. 

We use `pylint` and `black` with pre-configured configuration. We want everyone contributing code with these standards to have their tools configured correctly, and to be aware to adhere before merging any commits! 

## 8. Testing Guidelines

We strive for high test coverage to maintain the robustness of our code base. Writing test ensures a quality project for years!  We follow test driven approaches when available so new code comes with automated testing and coverage metrics available in build environments.

The test suites should pass. Before opening pull requests with substantial code changes: verify you have adequate test code for new additions or alterations of existing modules and functionalities!  Automated toolchain runs and displays code coverage statistics, and we require 80% of all production level functionality must achieve code test coverages

The current framework uses the standard unittest package within the same project directories and should align within coding practices already adopted within this framework, but alternative tools or packages will be assessed when the use can prove value beyond those used today. 

## 9. Documentation Contributions

The user experience starts here: great docs. We value documentation just as highly as our core software and expect a commitment towards it when contributions. 

All documentation should be located under `/docs` and stored in reStructuredText (reST). Please be consistent with current styling practices when writing, modifying, or expanding.

Clear writing, good use of formatting to emphasize, examples (lots of good working examples that run) will always improve documentation. No ambiguity. Always be descriptive! 

## 10. Commit Message Guidelines

Consistent and descriptive commit messages simplify reviewing, versioning, and troubleshooting our software's changes and histories! Commit message is a record that must have purpose, be easily interpreted, and add information that can assist a team of software development!

Please adopt a conventional commits strategy: `type(scope)! subject` format.  For instance:  `feat(search)!:  add filtering option` is acceptable format while just adding text with few context would not! Types like `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, and `test`.
`
This helps preserve project version histories that are easily interpreted for both human review or automatic tools! We encourage contributors, so all messages adhere, as a team of engineers will depend upon them when future code reviews.

## 11. Branching Model

This project uses Git Flow as a strategy with main (releases) being primary code for stable release version, develop is secondary. This branching pattern supports feature-centric and bug fixes. 

New Features should start in feature-branch and be tested until merge ready and merged with 'develop.'
Therefore hot-fix bug should originate as a feature or patch-fix branches that get merge in "main". This ensures minimal risks and disruptions to existing codebase during maintenance

## 12. Review Process

Code is rigorously evaluated by project members during pull requests for potential code problems that might arise! This involves testing for edge-cases to prevent any unexpected behaviors during usage or scaling.
 
Changes can be approved, modified with requested comments (addressed) before final acceptance! Review is intended to make the product as safe as we possibly can! Expect a courteous exchange, but constructive comments for quality and improvements
 
After the reviews, if the tests and comments from the reviewing are met then final pull will happen! A maintainer or core committer can make that decision. A new tagged code will then happen with version numbers incremented for the next releases of our application!

## 13. Communication Channels

The preferred place for communication around the project and issues/feature proposals/questions etc: The public project issues and discussions. These will be a place that others can view for collaboration, too!

For immediate discussion of technical questions you can find our dedicated chat at https://discord.com/invite/... where developers hang around, but note that this may vary! The private group is available for team internal communication only
    
Always use these resources and be friendly in tone with fellow developers as it creates the right work envrionment, so please adhere with those guidelines to create collaborations for better products for end users

## 14. Security and Responsible Disclosure

Security concerns or bugs take utmost importance with high priorities.  Please report those to a security alert email at secure-alert@companyname.com and refrain any posting about issues. Do this as soon as as you can for best results

Any vulnerabilities or issues will not have details released public until it resolved, in order not give bad-actor a foothold and opportunity. 
 We encourage a coordinated release, but it will happen only under project's approval as to when a public posting is appropriate for transparency purposes 

## 15. Release Process

Our current releases happen on schedule as per the roadmaps outlined on github project! These follow Semantic Versioning: major changes require large refactors and changes and should always trigger a discussion prior! Minor marking signifies backwards changes to core functionality while patches signify minor changes to stability and fixes only!

Each code version gets tagged as 'x.y.z.commitid-hash ' to make it clear, so the build systems have an easier time to reference.  Changelogs will reflect major,minor patches so users will understand changes with their updates and can easily review them at will to ensure compatibility and usage guidelines 

## 16. Recognition

As developers contribute they receive credits for all of them to maintain transparency.  Credits get included at project-start page and changelogs so others can acknowledge them for efforts 

If you have significant contribution that are impactful to the overall software we acknowledge and credit in all project.  These may come into a variety different format so do not hestiate if a project adds value and impact to overall work to make that significance visible for you
 
## 17. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All code submissions need agreement on licenses! A signed CLA (Contributor License Agreement) will ensure contributors are not liable, but project maintains copyright to any submissions made

To get signed a license you should sign the document available at link to get it started https://linktothesignedcla .  After submission you need verification by core contributor so your license will go active
## 18. Resources and References

The best style guidelines are here! https://google.github.io/styleguide/python.html - use those. The project uses that and other best known conventions. The best resources include those. We always try for a consistent standard for everyone.
