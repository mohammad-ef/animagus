# How We Contribute

Welcome! We're thrilled you are here and considering to contribute. Your expertise helps us create better software! Contributing can be more than just code - it involves providing constructive criticism, testing, documentation, design suggestions, and much more.

We strongly belief that a project's vitality depends on a community of active participants; your efforts matter, no matter if big or small. Please review the below to get started on collaborating successfully.

Whether you're a coding expert or a user with a keen observation of the experience, your contributions will help us to improve and grow. We appreciate everyone' willingness to engage with the project and help build the best solution for a wide audience.

## 1. Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a collaborative, respectful, and inclusive environment for all.  Our community welcomes contributions from developers, users of all backgrounds, and experience levels. 

We expect all members to communicate respectfully, and to engage with each other professionally. Discrimination in all forms, including but not limited to race, ethnic or racial origin, religious belief, gender, gender equality, age, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, marital status, is completely intolerable.

Violating behavior, which includes disrespectful, discriminatory comments can result in warnings; suspension, and even, in extreme cases, permanent exclusion from the project, and the community involved.  We encourage everyone to address issues and concerns privately, if possible. 

We value a space where everyone feels safe contributing, and your cooperation is required to maintain such a standard. If you experience or witness any behavior contrary to these guidelines please report it to [insert contact for reports, e.g., maintain email address] promptly.

## 2.  Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have a suitable development environment. A good text editor, Git software, and the necessary programming language tools will be helpful. We use Git for version control.

To set up the project you should first clone this code repository, by entering the following commands. First, ensure git is installed:  `git --version`. Then: `git clone <repository URL>`.  Once cloned, you are good to go.

Create a new branch for your contribution, so you don' t affect the main code: `git checkout -b feature/your-contribution`.  Always ensure you keep this new branch up by re-basing or mergeing the main code.  

After completing the work, commit it using clear, concise messages following established guidelines.  Push your new branch to the repository and create a pull request, as described more specifically below in the PR section. This will start the revision and approval.

Finally, ensure before you start contributing you have all the necessary dependancies by navigating to the root folder and running `npm install` (or equivalent). This will download all dependencies from the package.json file and configure the project.

## 3. How to Contribute

We encourage a variety of contributions, not limited to just code changes. Submitting a clear bug report, suggesting a new feature, or improving documentation is just as valuable to the project as a substantial coding improvement.

If you spot a bug and have found how to reproduce it, reporting it on the GitHub issue tracker is an excellent way to contribute. This way the maintainers, and other contributors know what the issue is. 

We welcome feedback and suggestions for new features or improvements. Openly sharing thoughts can lead to a much more comprehensive solution, so don't be shy. Please do so on the dedicated discussion board for feature requests or new suggestions.

Submitting pull requests (PRs) is the main mechanism for incorporating your code changes into the project. Make sure your PR is well-documented, with tests, and addresses an existing issue whenever possible.

Before starting a substantial implementation of a feature, discuss it with the core maintain team. Early feedback on the approach can help ensure the change aligns with project goals, and avoid wasted effort.

## 4. Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug, search the existing issues to see if it has already been reported. If the same issue is identified, consider adding additional information to the existing report rather than creating a new one.

When reporting, be as specific as possible, describing your environment (operating system, browser, version of software). It also is very helpful to add steps you followed to cause the error to emerge.

Create a concise and reproducible example to illustrate the bug, if feasible.  Ideally the sample must work and exhibit the reported problems consistently, even on new and different systems.

Submitting through the "Issues" tab on our GitHub repository, ensure the issue has clear subject that reflects the issue, with the proper context regarding where the issues arise, the expected and observed behaviors. Include the minimal amount of data required.

## 5. Suggesting Enhancements

New features can enhance usability, functionality, or performance, and all feedback are valuable! When suggesting an enhancement, provide clear justification or rationale of why that improvement should be done.

A clear description and use cases help illustrate its value and potential benefits to other users or contributors, helping prioritize its relevance for future releases. 

Prioritization relies on the number of interested user bases or contributors to validate enhancement proposals. Consider discussing potential enhancement proposal before you spend hours implementing, or even thinking to start it.

We encourage maintainers, core contributor teams and external stakeholders review suggestions. Feedback and refinement are essential aspects during brainstorming to create well designed features and to minimize technical debt in a future project iteration. 

## 6. Pull Request Process

The pull request (PR) process provides an organized approach. Start by branching from either `main` or `develop`, and make your changes on that new branch, and always update with recent updates, using rebase if appropriate.

Ensure all changes pass linting checks, tests are added to cover code alterations, along with any other automated validations and tests required. Make it a clear assessment of quality by addressing the potential problems or risks before submitting.

Your Pull Request requires clear commit messages, adhering to conventional commits, to explain each commit concisely and meaningfully for maintainer to understand the evolution process and impact to overall code architecture.

When the changes are approved, a maintainer reviews and merges them. Merging can be delayed to include necessary modifications. This step can be automated, or manual, with varying degrees of testing requirements and validation checks performed on PR merge stage.

Before your pull request gets approved it may need revisions. Implement feedback in separate, clear and atomic commits to allow easier validation and assessment by team member involved.  Communicate actively in the pull request discussions and ensure to address questions in a concise matter.

## 7. Coding Standards

To maintain a uniform code quality throughout the project we have set a set of code conventions for coding standard that we encourage developers and team members to follow strictly to build consistency

Consistent coding practices, which include correct formatting of indentation with proper spacing (four spaces recommended), descriptive variable and function names. Adhering standards is vital and should improve collaboration, readability, maintenance in all stages.

Our linting and format tools, automatically enforces a lot of code standard practices (using pre-commit hooks to catch common errors, and format code to the defined conventions). These help maintainers keep an up-to-date quality.

Ensure your contributions include appropriate JSDoc style comments that document your APIs and explain your logic and assumptions in an explicit way in line code comments where it helps clarity the flow

## 8. Testing Guidelines

Write and run unit tests whenever making a modification in code or logic flow in existing modules, as tests provide clarity to maintain current implementation state in code and avoid unwanted future behavior regression issues.

Utilize testing frameworks such as Mocha/Jest, ensuring all test are run during a pre-commit and the CI system, with clear and consistent failure conditions that are well reported to facilitate efficient problem debugging resolution, 

Aim for high test coverage (above 80%) whenever possible as higher percentage helps minimize regression risks.  Integrate your tests into existing automated builds or create separate dedicated test pipeline, which helps to automate quality checks for incoming modifications

When contributing regression tests that expose unexpected issues in specific conditions make sure those conditions get covered. This ensures that any potential issues in these specific edge case scenarios do not get reintroduced when refactoring, updating.

## 9. Documentation Contributions

Document your changes to reflect changes (APIs) made to any components, functions in new code contribution by following existing doc templates for a unified experience in reading

Existing doc locations should always have consistency, in the same style (reStructuredText), following same formatting conventions that makes all contributions to docs seamless, readable, easy to use in documentation. 

When writing updates ensure clarity with precise definition on the intended purpose with accurate information in each document sections for all stakeholders, developers or consumers of this software product or component library

Ensure all doc links (e.g., links, examples to the external references) is valid for easy accessibility in any environment or configuration. Always review any doc contributions with existing docs maintainers for alignment on consistency of quality.

## 10. Commit Message Guidelines

To enable maintainers better assess historical commit history use commit titles in a structured manner to improve the traceability in builds history. Use the subject to explain changes briefly but explicitly for all collaborators involved in the projects development.

Adopt Conventional Commits, following established conventions (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore), helps to automatically trigger automation, version bumps based commit message format to simplify deployment pipelines to new version release stages.

Concise descriptions should describe *what* the changes address and the high-level *why* it should get addressed. If a single change requires many modifications then breaking it to atomic chunks of small and meaningful messages improves readability for team mates or external contributor reviews

Ensure all commit bodies follow clear and precise structure for each of them.  Explain detailed logic changes that can provide valuable insights when developers have trouble understanding code behavior or reasoning when debugging issues during testing, review

## 11. Branching Model

We adhere to Gitflow which uses dedicated feature branches that paves ways toward streamlined parallel developments and easy collaboration between various teams. This also allows a single source to track releases of the product at all levels of releases.

Always ensure you are creating your new contribution off either from the `main` (release stable), `develop` (development and staging for next planned version releases) for better tracking for your code evolution, version tracking, stability.

Ensure that feature and branch conventions adhere, so you know at glance if this is a `feature/*` branch intended, hotfixes should follow specific standards that ensure code is not breaking current version stability during integration or release phases

## 12. Review Process

All Pull Requests get thoroughly vetted through team maintainers, or dedicated quality review crew that assesses, evaluates code standards adherence before final merge approval. Maintainers are always on-board on providing constructive and helpful advice to all contribution submitters

We prioritize code correctness. Code review also focuses heavily on potential performance regressions, code quality metrics (test code), maintainability to minimize future code debt during ongoing enhancements and development stages in the codebase evolution.

We value open discussion and feedback on each pull request and provide opportunities for contributors, stakeholders to actively review it to ensure code adheres to standards, expectations and requirements across entire teams, contributors to minimize issues, regressions down.

After merge we update project's history. We update our version to track the change for all downstream systems consuming this software project and publish releases with proper bump according version change to track stability for future release stages to the consumer applications.

## 13. Communication Channels

The GitHub Issues tab remains our main channel for reporting bugs and discussions regarding project functionality and improvements, and is monitored daily, for feedback on all contribution stages to provide a responsive support cycle to community developers.

For general conversation we are using Gitter chat for all discussions about general architecture changes in design and code quality enhancements as these often benefit a quick conversation.  Links can also shared for additional context.

Please reach out with questions or concerns regarding the codebase through any of those communication avenues, so our contributors get a chance and opportunity in improving project as a team, working on all challenges together with a strong unified vision in all contribution stages.

## 14. Security and Responsible Disclosure

We deeply value our users and stakeholders to report possible potential and possible issues with secure systems for any possible malicious threat mitigation for overall code security for project to ensure the project can stay protected and resilient over the time periods, 

When discovering possible and probable issues in system code or components immediately contact at secure_@company.com for further and deeper review with our expert teams before exposing possible risks that exposes project code, infrastructure for all parties, developers or users involved in project lifecycle stages

Responsible Disclosure means reporting a finding to security@email_project before disclosing public to minimize potential impacts that might be associated for exposure vulnerabilities. Please follow guidelines for reporting any issues efficiently, in order. 

## 15. Release Process

New releases will typically occur based on schedule with automated deployments that include all changes from `main`. Automated build, integration testing are automated for continuous releases for new updates and changes across platforms that consumers and downstream depend

We leverage version number bumping to reflect feature set additions in code when we do releases that adhere to semantics. Each feature addition and changes in version gets reflected in a clear manner.  Semantic Versions also provide visibility to consumer and downstream teams on stability impacts and risks associated for upgrades

The change log should contain an explicit record that covers any significant change made across each releases including new features or features removed from existing product components in each versions

## 16. Recognition

Active contributors can earn a credit for their involvement. We will add the list on project's readme, as we value their effort and hard-work on code, and we recognize it to provide additional boost to motivation to help project to continue thriving in any stages involved

Maintainer's also acknowledge contributor in change logs and any documentation to recognize efforts made the community for improving codebase with all possible suggestions made, contributions made across entire code cycle,

Our goal and purpose, it's all contribution is acknowledged, valued and credited to build appreciation from project teams in all stages and aspects. 

## 17. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

We utilize Contributors License Agreement which provides clarity on legal aspects when external teams make code submissions that allows our projects to be shared, redistributed without issues for our consumers or partners to benefit without legal conflicts in various deployment states.

Signing a CLA allows you and project ownership team a clear agreement on code, license terms, legal responsibilities for code submissions across different contribution lifecycle stages from code reviews. Please refer link at CLA for further legal terms of contribution in project stages involved
