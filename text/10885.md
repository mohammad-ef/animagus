# contributing Guidelines

## 23 Introduction ##

We value contributions of all kinds to make this project a success. Every contribution - whether it's fixing a typo within the documentation to adding a complex new functionality - helps us improve. By engaging and contributing code, you become a key element in a shared collaborative effort, fostering growth through shared experience.

This guide provides clear information on how to effectively contribute to this open- source project and ensure that your submissions align with our project requirements. It will outline guidelines on coding standards, pull requests, and reporting bugs. Your contributions are valuable to us and we welcome your participation with open arms, both code contributions and non-code related contributions.

We are always eager to welcome new developers, designers, writers, and community enthusiasts. Your input helps us maintain high quality across all our aspects. Let’s work together to build a great software project.

## <a id="#code-of conduct"></a> Code of Conduct.

This project is committed to building community around a positive and inclusive experience. We expect everyone to interact with respect, empathy, and kindness in all interactions with other participants. Harassment, bullying, or disrespectful behavior are never tolerated.

We believe that collaboration is essential, therefore open communication and willingness to learn from each other are highly appreciated. Be considerate of differing viewpoints and backgrounds.  If you believe a behavior violates this standard, please privately report the issue to project maintainers via [Insert Communication Channel Here, e.g. email or private message]. Please note that we can take various actions including, warnings, request to leave the project, or banning, for any violation

Creating welcoming and safe community is a shared responsibility, and it starts with respecting and valuing each of our contributors. We will actively listen to and address concerns to ensure the continued health and inclusivity of our project's ecosystem. Your participation is essential to building a welcoming place to contribute. 

 ## <a id="#get-started"></a> Getting Started.

To start contributing effectively, you will need to set up a local development environment. First, create a fork of the project repository on GitHub.  Clone the repository to your machine by running `git clone <your-fork-url >`. This will set up your local copy.

Next, create a new branch for your work: using command like `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`, where the name should be descriptive of what it is. We strongly recommend not creating branches directly from the main branch but from a branch called `develop`.

You' ll likely need the correct dependencies for building and running the project, which can vary based on project specifics and should be described in the main repository' documentation (e.g. a ` requirements.txt` file for Python).  Run `pip install - r requirements.txt` or equivalent for your programming language and project setup. 

To build the project for testing purposes, run `python setup.py build` or similar command, depending on the programming language and build tools. The build output should create necessary distribution archives ( e.g. a wheel file). The specific instructions may vary, so consult the project's main README.md for specific details.

Finally, remember to periodically pull the latest changes from the original repository to keep your fork up-to-date: using `git remote add upstream <original-repository url>` for adding upstream and `git pull upstream main` or appropriate branch to stay consistent.

## <a id="#how-to-contribute"></a> How to Contribute.

There is a plethora of opportunities to contribute to our open source endeavor. Reporting bugs helps us to identify and address issues that impact project quality. Suggesting features can expand our tool's functionality to better address user needs.

Submitting pull requests is the primary mechanism for incorporating your code contributions. Improving the documentation is also a great way to contribute. Well-written documentation helps other users understand and adopt our project.

Don’t hesitate to open an issue on GitHub if you think an feature could enhance project's overall functionality or improve our product offering. Discuss your proposed solution on this open space before writing too much code. A preliminary check will avoid redundant work on solutions and will lead to better collaboration across maintainers.

## <a id="#reporting-bugs"></a> Reporting Bugs.

Before submitting a bug report, make sure it hasn't already been reported by checking existing issues on GitHub. This step will prevent redundancy. Also try replicating and isolate it to the smallest testcase for better debugging process.

Please provide clear, detailed steps on how to reproduce the bug: This significantly reduces our effort of investigating your submission and ensures efficient solutions for bugs, so we make it clear how the bugs arise.. The report must clearly describe which behavior the project shows against expectation as well. Include screenshots, stack traces or any other supporting evidence can significantly speed up the diagnosis and correction steps

Be precise regarding your operating system version and environment details - e.g., language runtime version. The best place to submit the issue and include a concise summary is on the issue tracking on GitHub under this repository [Specify URL of GitHub Issue Tracker] to keep track of bug fixing process, as the process is open for collaboration across multiple people and is accessible for everyone to keep abreast of developments and progress in our efforts

## <a id="#suggesting-enhancements"></a> Suggesting Enhancements.

When suggesting enhancements or new features, clearly articulate the problem that it will solve, why that is necessary, or its intended outcome: Describe a situation that could make your suggestion worthwhile and how the new enhancement will positively change that circumstance

Explain potential use cases and what user group benefits directly: Describe what these improvements can bring in terms of value addition, such as increased ease-of use for users in different situations or providing new possibilities and capabilities for project usage

Project maintainers assess the suggestions based on multiple considerations and priorities like impact on core functionalities, development resources. They consider existing roadmap to make decision eventually - the evaluation is a thoughtful decision-making exercise, not an immediate "yes" or "no". Expect that it will be carefully and fairly considered, and also provide feedback on whether a new idea may require changes and refinements to improve overall quality.

## <a id="#pull-request-process"></a> Pull Request Process.

Fork the repository, clone it to your local machine and then create a branch with a clearly understandable purpose `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`, and start writing the new logic for it and/or modifying what needs modification and make appropriate testing to guarantee the quality of contributions

After committing your code locally to the feature branch write an expressive commit message, describing briefly but thoroughly why and what code change was applied to improve the codebase or correct bugs that may appear: Use the guidelines detailed under *Commit Message Guidelines*. When all tests passed locally submit changes as pull request against main or develop depending of what is project guidelines to maintain codebase stability.

Once a pull request is submitted the core team members of this repository review your work. Expect comments asking for modifications and clarification: Address the reviews as fast as you can with modifications of submitted logic to satisfy the project expectations in all the different dimensions - code style and content clarity and bug correction. Once everything checks with team requirements they approve the Pull Request for the codebase integration by mergig

## <a id="#coding-standards"></a> Coding Standards.

Maintain coding readability to enhance understanding and improve maintainability across contributors in future efforts - this means proper use of naming variables as the logic behind, indentation consistency with appropriate level, code commenting where clarity needs emphasis to explain specific behaviors for other team players to catch

Use static code analysis (Linting tools such as Pylint for python, or ESLint for JavaScript): These ensure coding best practices by highlighting common stylistic violations or structural flaws. Also utilize the language type checkers such as Mypy, or JSDoc for JS: This ensures type compatibility across various function interfaces improving project code base stability, by ensuring that all types in the interfaces match expected definitions and declarations. Ensure the codebase is documented properly by using docstrings, and code descriptions as the best possible explanation

Adhere strictly to a coding guide such as Google Style, PEP 8 - it provides comprehensive recommendations about code style:  It promotes readability as necessary across different teams and developers that will collaborate to develop, and maintain project quality over the lifetime - and is easily found through quick googling search

## <a id="#testing-guidelines"></a> Testing Guidelines.

Ensure all changes you contribute will trigger automated running to confirm appropriate functionality and correctness across various dimensions, including code paths that need thorough examination and debugging by using tests - so we have automated tools in charge as first layer before merging into a shared repository and to maintain the project codebase

Before you start adding tests you need to use existing tests for verifying existing behavior and make changes only with confidence of correctness - so we need all tests that pass initially. When introducing functionality, it may involve new edge case conditions which requires a unit testing implementation

Write multiple kinds of tests such as, for small components, or specific code logic, you should add unit tests; integration tests when multiple code sections interacts or dependencies must function as they ought; regression testing - these help verify old behavior is still consistent when new features and functionalities get incorporated. All new and changes should go along and include new/modifed code for ensuring overall correctness as much as you possible could and make the whole codebase stable across time periods.

## <a id="#documentation-contributions"></a> Documentation Contributions.

To provide users with accurate, detailed explanations for project components contribute improvements by enhancing project docs. Project files reside in `./docs/`, in a standard format for each language and tool (e.g. `rest`, `markdown` etc. depending the tool), which allows automated builds of a project.
If your contribution introduces new API endpoints then add them and properly describe what are all input information and output responses using proper and standard notations such as open API or OpenAPI3, that are well understood for users. Be aware about consistency - if something does work or behave different then what it states document accordingly for avoiding miscommunications,

Ensure your contributions conform with established guidelines, as it promotes consistent documentation - so everyone understands, uses and enjoys this software and documentation to achieve maximum effectiveness with all project elements in place for all purposes that might be applicable, for various contributors

## <a id="#commit-message-guidelines"></a> Commit Message Guidelines.

Every commit you make on your repository branch, you're contributing directly in building up project code base; for it is highly suggested, following best guidelines on creating a proper message to make code more accessible, and more collaborative

Use short summary messages, that briefly describes a purpose of code changes (ideally below 50 characters) for readability of the log, for making easier understanding the changes that got merged and how it was built over all project's evolution; followed with detailed message to add all extra explanation and rationale that is needed
Adopt conventions of the project, following similar commit types to standardize the messages - `feat:` new code; `fix: `corrective bug fixes for project; `docs:` document and explanation additions. The consistent use promotes collaborative environment where people understand code contributions, what was done with the repository and the overall context, so easier tracking the evolution, for future maintenance
This standardization ensures maintainability of project and eases tracking of change across the whole timeline - as everyone understand changes by glancing a few key phrases on top of each entry in a git-history.

## <a id="#branching-model"></a> Branching Model.

We utilize the "Trunk-Based Development" to manage changes. Developers create new feature or bug fix directly on the `develop` branch to maintain code quality - that's a common best-practice, that avoids merge complexity issues
Always branch for work, using meaningful descriptive prefixes for naming: for feature creation and improvements: prefix the feature/ with short summary describing functionality that you implement or fix - `feature/account-creation`,  and similar style, for fixing issues or regressions on existing project code - prefix them using:  fix/**short bug description - bug-auth`. Avoid naming branch for anything not relevant.
After all your code and documentation changes have merged and validated in local machine, then open a PR and submit the pull requests against our repository'

## <a id="#review-process"></a> Review Process.

All submitted changes through a pull request go into thorough reviews, so it makes code more consistent with our coding practices; to identify all defects early, as they can affect all aspects - stability as security as project design - before they're included to codebase and become a bigger issue in time.

We provide feedback and comments for modifications of PR: so they align best project requirements as we can achieve best possible code quality. It's important respond quickly so that we maintain velocity as best as possible in project and keep track to progress in all dimensions. After addressing and resolving reviews, pull requests can move forward in integration into code - as long there is an unanimous agreement and no issues are blocking progress

The process ensures all changes, and modifications have been checked by several individuals before being accepted and fully implemented, so we guarantee code base remains stable - that can withstand any potential risks

## <a id="#communication-channels"></a> Communication Channels.

Please engage and ask questions or raise suggestions and ideas, through this Github Repository: using issue tracking and Pull Request discussion channels, that provides great collaboration platform - where maintainers as all users of our software will collaborate
To connect to project and share opinions you can join [Chat channel tool like slack/Discord or email group - specify details], or reach maintainers, by sending a message, using Github' contact section [specify details of email]. We will promptly and reliably engage, for solving queries and addressing any suggestions - that can enhance this code project
Maintain open discussions as much as it may be possible for fostering collaboration environment among all participants

## <a id="#security-and-responsible-disclosure"></a> Security and Responsible Disclosure.

We value security, and it's essential for all projects in any form to guarantee stability: please report it to us directly if a potential risk of vulnerability, or other possible security threat exists in codebase; avoid any potential disclosure publicly.

Reach a dedicated person for vulnerabilities via private channels [e.g., dedicated email/secure messenger or contact on security mailing lists], so our experts could evaluate potential threat quickly as much as needed, while ensuring that it will not cause disruption in community
After acknowledging the issue it may get incorporated by maintainers as quickly as they possibly can to protect user data and prevent attacks that will compromise our codebase and its security

## <a id="#release-process"></a> Release Process.

To deliver the code changes in an organized approach that is transparent we have specific release processes.  Before each release all contributors need to follow guidelines that are defined.

After changes merge we prepare a release - by first tag a code version - which conforms sem-version [Specify semantic version standard - i.e `Major.Minor.Patch `]: which represents new functionalities as corrections to existing ones. A `CHANGELOG` must also update, that documents significant code updates
The deployment steps involve deploying built package artifacts across platforms and repositories. After the code and package have all verified by QA we make releases and updates. The deployment strategy may need specific steps and requirements to ensure proper functioning, for that you check [Specify deployment document link if there one.]

## <a id="#recognition"></a> Recognition.

Project is always striving to properly credit every contribution made to it; by making it easier accessible across users of all backgrounds to acknowledge and value efforts made by different team elements

Contributors listed within the code base [in Readme as credits.md]; with names as contribution details. All changelog releases are documented with contribution details - for better transparency for the team of how all enhancements were added and what types changes they represent - making everyone visible across all project user groups as valuable contributor to overall quality of our shared open sourced code product

## <a id="#contributor-license-agreement"></a> Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

We utilize and follow standard open sourced contributor agreements [If required] to secure rights of intellectual rights of software. This ensures that you retain copyright, however project will grant permissions as needed to be reused, or adapted for other users of codebase.
By joining, it signifies a commitment - and it ensures our legal standing in all circumstances of future code reuse and project adaptation as the project evolves - which ensures all rights remain clear across contributors for future development as well as future licensing

## <a id="#resources-and-references"></a> Resources and References.

Refer our [Project's main README file]: as source for overall setup and usage; also for specific dependencies that we require as the foundation, as a core set that helps you to set it right from first run - to make sure all aspects and elements get properly initialized - with no friction, in your project local build environment and execution

Adhere with established standard coding guides: such Google style for all code, [Refer Style guide Link], which improves project readability; as this improves all maintainers understanding across code changes that happen - that will ensure that we are building, as maintain as high standards of our software project
[Specify Link - to documentation/dev tools for specific frameworks].
