## Installation Instructions

First, you'll need to ensure you meet the project prerequisites: a C ++ 17 compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC), Qt 6.x development libraries, and CMake build system. It' s best to have a development environment set up before you install.

To begin, clone repository from the Git repository using the following:
```bash
git clone https:// github.com/ your-organization/ securevault- pro # Replace with your repository URL
cd securevault- pro
 ```

Next, ensure you've installed Qt 6 with the necessary modules for C++ development. This often involves using your platform specific package manager:
```bash
# Example using apt on Debian/Ubuntu
 apt- get install qt6- base-dev qt6- gui  qt6- network- dev
 ``` 

Create a separate build directory within the project' s root to organize your build artifacts. This keeps the main source directories clean and avoids clutter:
```bash
 mkdir build
 cd build
 ```

Then, execute CMake to configure the project. Provide the path to your Qt 6 installation if not auto- detected:
```bash
 cmake - DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/ path/ to/ Qt/ qmake  ..
 ```

Run CMake on your platform and make sure Qt installation can be detected: 
Linux: Ensure you've added your Qt include paths and libraries.
MacOS: Make sure that the XCode command-line tools are installed using the terminal with this:
```bash
 xcode- select- install
 ```
Windows:  The path of `qmake` will depend on where the Qt binaries have been stored; adjust to that location if different from example above.

Now compile project to the target platform by executing CMake's generate function: 
```bash
 cmake -- build # On most platforms (Linux, macOS)
  
 cmake --build . --config Release # for MSVC. 
 ```
This step compiles project files to create the release. It can take considerable time and depends heavily on computer processing power and resources. 

Following compiling project code with success: Run tests to confirm installation. If there're errors: check all of dependencies installed with correct libraries being linked to ensure the proper setup for compilation of source code, or re install the application:
```bash
 ctest 
 ```

Finally install with CMake command, if you desire, but is optional and not always a good option as you might break existing setup and installation configurations of libraries, especially for testing and development, which can make development cumbersome.
```bash
 cmake -- install # optional 
 ```
