# PyStock - A Simplified Stock Market Analyzer

A Python application that analyzes stock data, calculates fundamental indicators and generates basic investment recommendations, aimed towards beginner- and intermediate-level finance enthusiasts.  It simplifies the overwhelming amount of financial data into a readable and understandable form and helps identify potentially profitable investing opportunities. The project's goal is education and accessibility, not professional trading advice.

## System Architecture

Py Stock uses a modular design, splitting responsibilities across three key components: data acquisition, analysis and reporting. First, a data scraping module gathers historical stock prices.  Next, an indicator calculation module computes technical & fundamental data, and finally, a reporting module produces visualizations and simple investment ideas based off the analysis. 

The application relies heavily on the `yfinance` library for stock data, `pandas` and  `numpy` for data manipulation and calculations, and `matplotlib` for charting. Data flows sequentially through the different components allowing modifications in data acquisition, without breaking core functionality.

A simplified data-driven pipeline allows rapid development. New indicator types and visualizations can be introduced in separate components. This design encourages maintainability and expandability, supporting more functionalities with little impact on others. 

## Description

PyStock aims to empower individual investors by providing simplified analysis of stock market data. We solve the information overload challenge faced by those beginning their journey into investing. PyStock's main function is the automatic calculation of commonly used financial ratios such as the Price-to-Earnings ratio, Debt-to-Equity ratio and others, along with simple charting features.

It focuses on delivering actionable insights in a readily consumable manner for those learning the intricacies of financial data analysis. By offering a pre-configured analysis pipeline and easy-to-understand charts, the application minimizes complexity, accelerating users learning and initial understanding of investing metrics. 

Our approach utilizes widely used, yet easily understandable, formulas and technical analyses which create insights that users new to finance are readily able to grasp. By avoiding excessive customization complexity and keeping the focus squarely on clarity for the target users, this application helps accelerate financial knowledge attainment. 

We use publicly available APIs such as Yahoo Finance for stock data ensuring ease and accessibility in gathering current and historical stock market details, making our analyses timely and accurate. By utilizing common data resources, the app can operate reliably while keeping costs and complexities associated with alternative resources minimized.

PyStock prioritizes creating visually-accessible and intuitive outputs with clear, understandable reports on a stock, and recommendations are designed with beginners in mind, offering insights without the risk of misinterpretations. These reports can provide users an accessible foundation to start forming educated and informed investment strategies and build financial confidence.


## Installation Instructions

Before you start, ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system. This can be verified by running `python3 --version` in your terminal. 

Install `pip`, Python installer if necessary for your platform by referring to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You should have administrator or `sudo` rights when using package installation on a server system.

Once Python is properly set up, navigate to the directory where you downloaded or cloned the PyStock repository. 

To begin installing project dependencies, execute the `requirements.txt` file by utilizing this terminal command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.  Make sure to update your package versions as new versions get published periodically.

You can find our list of Python modules on this page for further inspection of package dependency.

To resolve permission-related installation problems when installing libraries globally (e.g., using `sudo pip install`), try using a virtual environment for dependency management.  Tools like venv, pipenv, or conda will allow creating an isolated package ecosystem without altering your main environment installation settings.

In the event of encountering specific install error codes for certain packages, you can search through package related forum threads. The `requests` and `matplotlib` modules sometimes require installing pre-requisites. Consult official documentation for more help with this situation.

After completing all of the required dependency installations, try re-installing your packages and verifying they install appropriately without the same error encountered originally. It could just be the original installation was corrupted and requires refreshing the process to succeed.

After installation has been finalized without problems, try executing a short script with PyStock and its associated components and libraries that you recently downloaded, installed and confirmed were successful on your environment setup. This will allow verifying functionality across modules and their interdependency within this package ecosystem. 

Finally, if any dependency installations are problematic or fail to load, consult the project GitHub issue page on how the problem could have already been resolved and what possible solutions may need implementation at the system configuration or package install stage. This may provide insights in addressing and debugging problems quickly!



## Usage Instructions

To begin analyzing a stock, first launch the main application script `pystock.py` from your terminal, navigating to your downloaded folder, with `python3 pystock.py`. It presents an initial stock search window that requests for the ticker name from user and then executes its data and analytics modules, presenting information accordingly.

Enter the ticker symbol (e.g., 'AAPL' for Apple) and press Enter. The application will fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, including Open, High, Low, Close prices. This step will trigger automatic data gathering, indicator calculating & chart plotting modules as the app analyzes the stock information entered.

Next, view a chart displaying the stock price movements, including key dates and calculated fundamental ratio, and the calculated data and visualizations are designed to be clear for users unfamiliar with investment tools, displaying key statistics like price trends & financial indicators in easy-to-understand visuals format. You could use `help(pystock.py)` for help.

You can then use advanced command-line arguments such as specifying the start and end dates of historical data to refine and personalize calculations and analysis by appending command flags in the console window with a space to delineate arguments and input flags in proper form and sequence for successful data fetching and interpretation from data resources, e.g.).` python3 pystock.py -start 2023-01-01 -end 2023-12-31 AAPL`.

For generating future forecasts (currently experimental), include `-forecast <number_of_days>` when running the application. It employs time-series models and is not suitable for critical trading. This command will attempt predictions with current implementation using the specified days ahead from date entered in console to provide insight on potential outcomes, though should never be considered absolute truth due solely limited nature forecasting methodologies applied by this app..

Explore available features using help options by launching from shell by appending a `--help` option:  e,g.). `pystock.py --help`  for more command options & parameter usage to enhance the experience with the software..



## Configuration

The PyStock application's behavior is controlled primarily through command-line arguments and configuration within its code itself and through an environmental setup that dictates certain data processing behaviors as described below for user customizations.

Environment variables such as `API_KEY` may affect external service calls and should ideally reside external configuration and environment files rather within codebase as a deployment-level configuration setting. 

Default settings include 5 years historical dataset retrieval, 20 days moving average computation for momentum indication, with 10 day forecast predictions.

Custom data selection intervals can be implemented, with `--start` & `--end` to specify custom time period range during stock market evaluations. For data storage settings for data-saving or data-sharing capabilities and features in future release plans can also affect program behaviors through these parameters

You may configure specific technical indicator formulas, and plotting configurations to tailor data output and for scenario analyses - these options will eventually allow custom data calculations to match users individual analytical strategies and approaches with flexibility for developers in building custom configurations, offering more tailored data output to users' preferences in financial evaluation practices, allowing users further control to their stock-data evaluation experience through customizable data parameters!

Further modifications include setting chart styles preferences and default stock data download directory. 

For advanced settings, consider directly adjusting configured data sources & their respective API parameters within application settings file `config/stock_api.yaml`. However modifications will apply program-wide affecting its functionality; therefore caution should remain prior undertaking these modifications and ensure thorough review documentation and sourcecode understanding!

## System Architecture

PyStock operates upon modular system to separate its core functionalities into different distinct components, ensuring ease maintenance - extensibility for evolving features - improving reliability & adaptability. Data retrieval module first connects and obtains stock price & other key financials for specific tickers. It utilizes the yahoo API for stock data.

Then indicator-computation engine then uses retrieved stock info in various computations of technical ratios. These calculations include metrics like Price/ Earning ratio to determine valuation; also, includes Debt-to-Equity Ratio & Moving-Average to gauge company financial leverage or trend momentum - which gives investor better understanding for potential profitability of investment

After calculating financial information the plotting routines create intuitive graphs and plots to convey information clearly, making content digestible - even with no experience! These plots display trends/ ratios visually to help decision - making! 

Lastly, PyStock has flexible design. It's easy extend - adding support to interoperate external data providers (like alternative-API services and financial datasets for diverse insights and enhanced analysis) without requiring overhaul entire architecture. Modular framework supports easy customization, making PyStock a valuable and powerful investing evaluation assistant for everyone regardless level expertise!
## API Reference

PyStock offers command-line based interactions instead having dedicated web service endpoints - simplifying setup deployments for end users, enabling easier integrations within existing data flows for stock assessments

**Core Functions:** `analyze_stock(ticker, start_date, end_date)` - This main engine computes fundamental and indicator metrics for a given company by retrieving its financials for provided timeframe. Input parameter include a 'ticker_value'(stock's stock market ID such: "MSFT", "AMD" ) as input for stock data - as also optional starting 'start_date and 'end_date''

Parameters are required for time range for financial evaluation; the returned values will contain computed technical indicator scores (moving Average - price- earnings, DE-ratios, along volatility metrics and plotted visual outputs in console) 

Example use is running with console by using command such 'python3 pystock.py  MSFT -start 2023-01-01-end -2024-01-01'

The API utilizes `yfinance.download()` and `pd.DataFrame`. The data will also go to internal `plot_stock_price` as well `generate_recommendation()` routines that provide data for evaluation.

For future expansions the application would be expanded towards REST APIs with dedicated HTTP EndPoints, offering broader data interaction with diverse software, applications for easier automation of workflows for evaluation tasks in real time scenarios!  This is on project development path! 
## Testing

Comprehensive automated routines have integrated for ensuring the correctness stability and code functionality throughout all PyStock module operations, including test coverage of various financial indicator implementations! Testing involves several components, ensuring reliability - quality.

PyStock's framework includes modular design which enables comprehensive and focused testing. Individual components - e.g, 'indicator_computation engine and chart creation engine' have independent test cases validating specific behaviors for individual units to enhance quality control, isolating faults quickly - efficiently to pinpoint problem origins, enhancing overall system robustness!

Unit-test coverage is maintained with pytest to verify all essential features, routines with thorough data set tests in order to evaluate edge - conditions & reliability - performance for different market states . This framework provides consistent test results to ensure accuracy across modules, guaranteeing that the data is processed reliably & that data is interpreted precisely across the whole system architecture! 

Run PyStock automated evaluation with console with `pytest`. To run comprehensive set tests from root-repository launch using pytest module. This triggers full suite - evaluation to guarantee complete test execution with detailed - output results that highlight failures, issues, errors - providing valuable data-input yield during the testing & debugging procedures.   



## Troubleshooting

Commonly installed packages - `yfinance and matplotlib`, occasionally face dependency versioning errors, particularly during package upgrade.  Resolving involves checking specific versions compatibility or installing required prerequisite libraries for those specific components! If problems remain consider updating or uninstall-reinstall dependencies for compatibility fixes, or using alternative versions if conflicts emerge in environment

Yahoo-Financial-API has occasional service availability or data consistency errors when retrieving recent financial figures for low capital stock values! This issue resolved temporarily through error management and data retry loops or through waiting to resolve - allowing Yahoo Finance system stabilize & provide valid financial details! If issue occurs for long - time consider data provider switching, for data resilience

Data parsing inconsistencies can emerge when retrieving financial details with unusual formatting. Ensure correct data cleaning-conversion routines to prevent data type mismatches that trigger unexpected results. Review error outputs - check correctness routines to handle variations, guaranteeing data-pars
