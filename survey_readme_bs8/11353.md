## Installation Instructions

The first step is installing prerequisites including python environment, dependencies, and a local build system. You can download these dependencies from official channels. The system requirements are a computer, with access to network services as the application will use cloud connectivity, a python 3 interpreter, and a terminal or shell for command executions. Ensure your computer is properly setup and that the python and terminal tools you will be using can interact seamlessly together.

You can then download the installation script, using your favorite terminal, by cloning the git repo or downloading it as an zip.  Make sure to extract the downloaded file, and navigate into the main installation folder to run any setup instructions contained. Ensure your computer or device has the appropriate read and access permissions before executing setup and configuration instructions.

Before starting, please check Python and pip installed. To check your Python installation, run ` python --version ` in terminal . If it' not installed or the version is below python3, download the official installer. Next, verify pip, using `pip--version `. If it' not installed, install it via ` sudo apt install python3-pip  ` or use the instructions on the pip website, for your specific operating environment. Make sure, after this step that these are working properly before proceeding,

You will need to install several Python packages using `pip `. The main requirement for setting up the core functionality of the automation and monitoring features will include libraries like `requests, schedule and paho-mqtt `, among others . Open terminal and run : `pip install  --upgrade pip`, after installing, you will need to run :  `pip install --no-cache -dir requests, scheduling, paho -mqtt` to install necessary components, and dependencies that A ether runs on. This can take a while.

On Debian/Ubuntu Linux, install the required system dependencies with:
```bash
sudo apt- get  update
sudo apt- get install build essential python3- dev
sudo apt update
```
On macOS, it is recommended to use Homebrew: `brew install python3 build-ess ential python`. For Windows, install the Python distribution with development tools, or the equivalent package manager. After installation, you will likely need to restart you shell for the required environment variables to load

Next, you should clone the Aether repository using `git`. This allows tracking of future updates for the platform as you use it.
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AetherSmartHome/Aether.git
  cd A ether  # Move directory to the new installation folder after cloning is complete
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory. This directory contains all required resources. Create the virtual envi ron ment using the `pip  env ` module.
```bash
  pip3  install venv
  python3   -mvenv env
  source env/bin/activate # Activate enviro n ment on Linux or macOS . On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate `.
```
The environment isolates the packages installed, and prevents conflicts. Once this step finishes successfully, all dependencies will be ready to launch A ether platform.

## Usage Instructions 

Once the platform is running locally, the UI can be accessed in a web browser, using a local address, for exmaple `localhost: 5000`. After opening up a browser, the platform should load, and a user login can be completed. Aether comes with a few sample rules and sensor setups which will allow users to start experimenting with the platform.  These rules and sensor setups should appear within the UI, which can then be edited to change the automation behavior, to customize to user requirements.

To create a basic rule, you must specify triggers ( events which will trigger the execution of a specific rule) and action sequences, which define the steps the platform will take following a trigger, such as turning on or off an electrical device, sending an email alert, sending an SMS, logging data, etc. The UI allows the creation of triggers based on a multitude of factors: time, sensor data, user location, etc.

To test rule triggering with sensors, connect a compatible temperature sensor device to the platform and ensure this appears in a UI listing of active sensor devices. The user can then configure a trigger based on a specific temperature reading. This will cause actions associated with that rule to be automatically executed, providing real time confirmation. This provides real time visual indication, that the platform can react appropriately to events within the smart home system.

For a more advanced usage you could create a rule which sends a push notification when a person enters or leaves the property, based on a geolocation of the user phone device. This requires integration with a push service, to send the notifications, but is a very practical real world application for a smart home automation platform, and a very powerful demonstration. This will also show how the Aether can integrate with external services and cloud connectivity, as the push service can be a 

The API also facilitates automated scripting, or external integrations. You can access endpoints via ` http://localhost: 5000 ` (adjust based on your local server setup ) and authenticate as necessary to interact with the core components of this automation framework,

Aether also has a logging system, providing insights into event and execution flows. This will help troubleshoot any issues encountered, by reviewing logs from device integrations and automation rule triggering. Logs help debug and ensure the platform is operating smoothly

## Configuration

Aether can be configured through a configuration file, which defines global settings, API keys and sensor integrations to the platform. This ` configuration.yaml ` file, can be found in the configuration directory, and is used to specify external integrations and device configurations that will be used by the smart automation system . This file contains various parameters to define the operation of the platform.

The ` configuration.yaml ` allows defining API keys for cloud integrations such as weather services, and push notifications. Each API key should be obtained from respective provider and securely placed in this configuration file. The `configuration.yaml ` file also specifies the MQTT broker settings. These include broker address, port, and user credential which allows the platform to connect to external MQTT services, for sensor and actuator device communication.

Aether's environment variables control various runtime behaviors like logging verbosity, debug mode, or API keys which may be sensitive. These environment variables, can be set within your host system or using a `.env ` file to configure specific variables like logging level, API keys, and external service connections, which are used to customize the system without directly modifying the configuration file,

The logging level in the ` configuration.yaml ` file, can be configured, to determine the amount of detailed information, logged by the automation platform. Higher logging level, such as ` DEBUG  ` will provide a more detailed insight into the internal processes, however, can generate a very substantial log file which may be overwhelming. The `logging  ` level provides detailed logs for all activities while the `INFO  ` log level only records important information which helps to optimize disk,

You can also customize the UI theme, and visual style through the ` configuration.yaml ` file, allowing a more personalized user experience, that matches the aesthetics of the smart home,

The ` security ` section in the ` configuration.yaml ` config file, can be used to define security settings which includes password encryption, user authorization policies and other access control configurations which are used to restrict unauthorized access or data manipulation,
