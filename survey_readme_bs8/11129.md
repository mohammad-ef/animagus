## Installation Instructions

Prerequisites to installing Tempo are having Docker and Compose installed on target machine. Make sure these are properly setup and working before attempting the Tempo installation. This allows the software deployment and execution in isolated containerized environments. These tools are available for various platforms - please follow platform- specific setup steps on the respective websites for proper functioning. 

Next you should clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github... (replace with project url)
cd Tempo
```  
This clones the Tempo source code repository, which includes all the required files and directory for the project. Make sure git is installed and working to properly fetch the repo contents into local machine. It' is recommended that you create local branch for development purposes before installing.  

The next step is to create a `.env` configuration in the `deploy` directory, as per the requirements of docker- compose. The file will need at least a password for database and admin user.
```bash   
touch .env
nano .env
```
You will then need to edit the file with values appropriate for production or test. For a production setup, ensure these are robust and securely encrypted.  

Now the installation is almost complete. It' is required now to build all the required docker images using `docker-compose`. The docker commands are executed from Tempo root directory. The Docker Compose tool will manage the entire build and deployment pipeline.

Building the image requires that you have access to internet for retrieving external dependencies during process. It is possible to download these ahead of time to minimize build process duration, especially in offline environments.
``` bash
docker-compose build
```

After build has finished we can bring everything up using the following:
``` bash
docker - compose up - d
```
It is recommended using `- d` in production setup. This launches container and runs them in background. It is useful when running multiple processes at a time. It allows the Tempo to run in the background. 

To view container logs you could execute command
  ``` bash
 docker-compose logs <service_name>
   ```
 Replace `<service_ name` with the specific microservice that you are investigating for errors. This can be a very efficient way to track down problems. 

Finally, to check that Tempo is running, navigate to ` http:// localhost 8000` and you should see the login page to create an account or login with admin. If everything has been configured correctly it should be possible to login as the default admin user, with password set in `. env` file.  

For macOS user, use `brew cask install docker` before running. On Window users please use Docker Desktop instead of direct docker CLI. This will simplify the install experience. For some Linux distros, additional packages are often necessary.

## Usage Instructions

To begin, create an account or access as administrator with the username and password provided during setup (specified during the `deploy/.env ` file creation). After that, start by creating your first project. You can do so by logging in and going to ` Projects ` menu and clicking on button ` Create Project.` 

Then you should be able to create individual tasks under a specific project. Each task can be assigned a priority (High, Medium, Low ) and an estimated completion time. The UI provides a drag-and- drop mechanism for easy task ordering. The user can also set deadlines, add descriptions, and assign tasks to team members.

To view all pending tasks, navigate to ` Tasks ` in the navigation bar. This will display a list of all open tasks from all your projects, filtered by priority or deadlines. You are also presented with a search bar allowing filtering. This enables you to efficiently track overall progress. 

For advanced users API can be used via a REST API. All endpoints are documented at `/api/docs `, and can be accessed from the main Tempo application. API is authenticated by an API key. Generate it by logging in, navigate and select `Settings -> API`

Tempo offers several command-line tools that can be used to perform administrative tasks. For example, the `manage.py` script can be utilized to perform database migrations. It should be run within the Tempo environment.

You may customize Tempo using configuration files within ` configs` folder to adjust system parameters, API keys, database settings , and security policies based on project needs. These configuration files can easily be overridden during environment variable settings for dynamic adaptation. 

To view task progress in real-time, use the " Dashboard " view. This interface offers visualizations of your workload distribution. Progress bars and charts illustrate the current status of all projects and tasks. The UI will dynamically adjust the display when new tasks are complete.   

To export your task data for use by other software packages or to maintain archives for historical tracking , use export functions. Data can be exported to CSV or JSON, enabling seamless integration with different applications. 

The platform supports integration with third-party tools using webhooks. When task status or priority are changed, the system can notify external services or automate other workflow processes. The webhooks will allow for seamless and flexible workflows.  

For team members you could assign a new task by going to `Project -> Tasks` and using the "Assignee" field. The assigned user will be automatically notified of the task assigned in the notifications menu. Notifications can also be turned off in the settings section of each users preferences.   

To test performance of the system load test tools such as J Meter could be used. It could simulate hundreds or millions of users at a time providing useful data. This information could be useful for optimizing Tempo.

## Configuration

Tempo primarily uses environment variables and configurations files in `deploy/.env` for customization purposes. This modular approach provides flexibility to configure different deployments based on varying needs.  

Key environment variables include `DATABASE_ URL`, `REDIS_ URL`, API keys, and ` SECRET_KEY` for session encryption. It is critical that the `DATABASE_URL` and ` REDIS_URL` are configured for your specific database and redis setup.

Configuration files can override environment variables. The configuration files are stored within directory ` configs`. It contains settings for the frontend, backend, and other related components. It is recommended that you modify these files only when required. The file format is ` YAML`.  

The `SECRET_KEY` is critical security consideration. Ensure you use a strong, randomly generated key for session encryption, which protects the user data. Store it securely and do not commit it into version control.

Optional parameters can be passed via environment variables to configure features like email notifications, third-party integrations, and advanced logging. The availability of these configuration settings can vary depending on specific microservices.

For example, to configure the frontend, edit `configs/frontend. yaml`. This will affect appearance and functionality within the front end web application. To configure the backend edit `configs/backend. yaml `.

Tempo also supports custom themes using the theme management system within the frontend. To change the theme you go to ` User Settings -> Theme` and choose from a predefined list. Custom theme files can be added by modifying the `theme ` folder.

For performance optimization consider configuring caching options in the database and Redis, adjusting buffer sizes, and enabling concurrency settings.  The specific settings will depend upon the workload of the Tempo deployment environment. 

The logging configuration can be customized for detailed debugging and error tracking. You can configure different log levels, destinations, and output formats using the environment variables. Proper log rotation is critical to avoid the disk space issues when deployed to the production systems.   

Security settings can be customized in the `config/ security.yaml` file. Enable additional security features like CSRF protection and input validation. Regularly review security updates and apply necessary patches.   

When deploying to different environments use different configuration files. This will ensure your configurations are appropriately setup for each environment. You can also use environment variables to dynamically override some configuration files settings based on deployment conditions..

## System Architecture

Tempo utilizes a microservices architecture, dividing the functionality into separate services that can be deployed and scaled independently. The architecture is layered in nature and comprises several core elements working synergistically, to deliver overall performance

Frontend, React, handles user experience rendering data and handling interaction with the services in back in API call session, while API provides an abstracted way in order communication.. Backend contains various API endpoint implementation using framework and Python code which handle tasks, data models database interaction as per needs.. Data persistence is achieved utilizing the post gree sqll for efficient task and state storage and redis is a central caching for improving efficiency of operations.    

These individual services communicates and coordinates via asynchronous message-based system that utilizes queues (redis) for reliable delivery and coordination across service boundaries.. 

Data-Flow will generally starts when User interact in the front-end application sending requests via the APIs backend processes. The requests will routed via appropriate handlers within the services which retrieves and manipulates related state.. As a service performs its action will publish messages via message bus which enables the system in decoupling different parts of the application. This design ensures independent development deployments for scaling up different features without interference with another part application system architecture . This modular design improves overall robustness by reducing dependencies .

Key patterns are: Message queue to decouple the backend and ensure the the system resilience and loose couplings and microservicing to allow independent deploy.

## API Reference

Tempo's REST API exposes several endpoints, allowing you to integrate and programmatically control tasks . 

* **GET `/api/tasks`**:  Retrieve all tasks, supporting filtering parameters, such as due date or assigne to retrieve only particular items..

    **Parameters**:  `project_id`: The specific tasks that will need retrieved

* **POST `/api/tasks`**: Create a New Tasks. Requires the project, assignees to add a brand new items and description to system and track new activities and tasks
      
  **Body:** Project Id : task_desc  priority and due Date
     
* **GET `/api/users/{id}`**: Retrieve all task assignees to get a specific details to assign.

   **Returns:** {user id and details. description, project assignment details.}   

Detailed information and all the parameters supported by various methods and API are provided at documentation endpoint at ` http:// localhost 8000 /api/docs`. This will ensure the API calls and integration can proceed smoothly across systems without confusion, and will provide comprehensive understanding.

## Testing

To run automated unit tests, the framework and standards have set and are defined by project. Testing is crucial part of development lifecycle that is important ensuring high reliability .   

Testing Framework utilized includes:  Unit, functional.

Install pytest using  :

  ``` bash
    pip install pytest 
   ```   

Then the unit and functional testing scripts is executed through command `python test.py`. It provides output and results of various scenarios in testing environment . The system will generate comprehensive results of various testing runs . This provides insights.
Integration test suite includes various scenarios, and it ensures proper interworking and data exchange in components and integration across multiple micro services that are required during operation, which are executed in environment that mimics deployment conditions as per testing.

We recommend you run ` make test ` before making pull requests that is required for proper verification and ensure consistency.

## Troubleshooting

Some common installation issue involves docker or dependency errors which might occur. To diagnose, run docker-compose build with the - v flag in docker command . Check all docker service running using Docker commands in shell to confirm. Check the error for missing package, if any is encountered install them accordingly to resolve dependency problems with commands.

Configuration files must contain the correct information such a `DB _ HOST `, and other settings as per documentation, failure might trigger error or failure to deploy. To fix configuration check for the errors by validating all settings in ` yaml ` format for correctness and accuracy of configuration parameters and correct the mistakes accordingly

The frontends are known to fail dummy data if the server has no ports and is not properly listening.. The frontends might not have correct configuration of environment, so you should always verify environment parameters in production . To debug you might check by looking at server console output logs that provides more clarity.
      

## Performance and Optimization

Tempo can improve the system by caching frequent database lookups and by utilizing asynchronous queues in communication. To support scalability consider deploying services horizontally and implementing proper concurrency controls using load balances in high traffic scenarios for handling incoming tasks..  

Use benchmark examples and run them periodically. This provides baseline metrics for evaluating performance over iterations for optimization of Tempo and its underlying microservices . It can also identify the bottlenecks where optimizations could improve performance and provide valuable guidance..

Proper profiling can identify performance issues by analyzing and tracking the execution paths in different parts code that are critical areas and help identifying the most significant optimization .    

  

## Security Considerations

Secrets keys and configuration data need securely store and avoid hard coded secrets and instead, store these information with dedicated key-management services for improved control in secure access . Validate input into backend API by implementing security filters, sanitize parameters, preventing injections or other potential malicious code and protect application against various injection attacks that exploits backend.  

Regularly update dependencies of packages to address and eliminate new vulnerability discovered. Monitor the activity to log access control. Implement a system for quickly addressing new reporting security.
