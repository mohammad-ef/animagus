This repository contains code implementing the ` Task Managment Engine `, a flexible and scalable application for organizing and executing various task. It provides robust API' to allow other services interact with task creation, scheduling and execution, offering powerful automation capabilities.

This application addresses challenges around task coordination, prioritization, and resource management. By abstract away complexities, it allows developers streamline workflow integration into larger application ecosystems. It supports custom tasks, scheduled task triggers and real- time status reporting to ensure task execution meets expected timelines while adhering defined resource limitations.   The goal is to simplify managing task related operations for developers building larger systems

The engine's core architecture revolves around asynchronous task processing to maintain responsive system operation. It leverages a modular plugin architecture to enable extensions of core functionality. This allows users incorporate specific integrations or custom task handlers based requirements. It' also offers a rich API, facilitating integration with existing systems. This modularity promotes extensibility. This allows it to adapt evolving operational requirements.

TME provides a central management interface that displays real-time data related all tasks, including task statuses and execution progress. Developers can monitor, pause or restart tasks, and receive alerts when errors are encountered. This comprehensive management dashboard helps optimize workflow performance.   Moreover robust audit logging is available.

Ultimately, TME aims to empower developers simplify automation processes within application architectures. The goal is to provide the necessary flexibility needed to create custom task-oriented solution, reducing development time. This leads to improved application stability with optimized workflow execution.  We envision TME as cornerstone tool for modern automation workflows across wide variety use case applications.  It' also provides an event- driven notification architecture.

## Installation Instructions ##

Before installation please ensure you have the follow prerequisites installed: Python 3.8 ( or a greater version ), a virtual enviroment management system such as 'venv' installed , and pip installed. We strongly recommend using a venv for isolation purposes, which is best practice.  This avoids conflicts. You will also need a working PostgreSQL server for storing your TME data.

Next is to clone this repository from GitHub into preferred location on the system using the standard git commands ' git clone <repository_url>'. This will retrieve all files, directories, associated history. It' is recommended clone it into project folder. This keeps all projects organized, easily identifiable.

Following the cloning, navigate the newly downloaded directory using command line tools (' cd <repository directory>'). This action places you in directory that contains all project resources.  Subsequently run the following commands to install necessary dependencies.

Now create the required virtual environment by utilizing following command: `python3 -m venv .venv`. This establishes isolated environment. All project dependencies will installed into this isolated environment avoiding dependency conflict. It keeps the system clean.  Then activate the venv by using `source .venv/ bin/activate ` ( Linux) ` .venv\ Scripts\ activate` (Windows ). The system now operates within the project venv .

After environment has been activated run this to install all necessary dependencies. This will pull packages listed in the project's  ` requirements.txt ` file. Run the following to install all packages ` pip install -r requirements.txt`. If encountering errors verify pip version. Consider upgrading it before trying again. Ensure the system meets specified requirements, especially Python package compatibility versions.

After dependencies installed configure TME's database. This involves creating user database. Modify ` configurations / db_config.yaml` file, updating user name, and database name. This configuration file contains connection details. It' also specifies settings for connection pooling. Proper credentials are required here.

Finally, apply database migrations to set up the schema by running: ` python manage.py migrate`. It creates the initial database schema and tables. This action is essential. It allows TME's components interact the database appropriately. If migration failed carefully review error logs, ensuring that all configuration parameters are correct.

## Usage Instructions ##

To start the engine, navigate project' directory in your terminal. Execute the management script with follow command ` python manage.py runserver`. This command start the internal webserver. It handles all requests and responses from TME' core functionality. This starts local development mode. The system now operates within the project venv .

Now to interact with API send requests using standard HTTP clients ( like 'curl', 'requests' or equivalent library). TME provides multiple endpoints for tasks creation, status updates, and task cancellation. The base URL typically is ` http://1 localhost:8000`.

To schedule recurring task use the `/schedule ` endpoint. It needs to be configured properly. It accepts `task_name`, the interval at which the task run. For instance, to schedule `clean_logs` task that run every hour use POST request with JSON:  ` {"name": "clean_logs ", "interval": 3600}`. Proper validation should happen prior submitting requests.

You can also create on-demand tasks. The `/task/create` endpoint accepts the following parameters: ` name ` and ` command `.  For example, sending:  `{"name":"backup_data", "command":"/backup/run. sh"}` triggers task run immediately. Monitor task status using `/task/< taskId>` endpoint.

TME also supports event subscriptions. This allows you receive real -time updates task status. To subscribe to events use  `/events ` endpoint. Specify event type and callback URL for receiving notifications. It supports both JSON and XML data formatting. It provides the necessary feedback. The engine now actively processes all registered events .

To retrieve complete list all running tasks, send ` GET` requests to the `/tasks` endpoint. It returns JSON array of tasks along with status codes. This provides an easy mechanism overview of all active processes being handled T ME. Proper exception handling should be implemented.

## Configuration ##

TME' configuration heavily relies on YAML file ` configurations /  db_config .yaml `. This file holds all connection settings for interacting the PostgreSQL database. It includes database name, user name, host, password and port number for establishing database. This provides secure access.

The engine also uses a ` configurations / app_config .yaml` file. It stores general application parameters related task execution. The `default task timeout ` controls execution of all tasks. The ` event notification format ` parameter dictates response structure event notifications.

T ME leverages environment variables override configurations specified in YAML files. This is a best practice. It helps maintain security sensitive information outside configuration files. For instance the database password can specified via environment variable named `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, rather direct embedding configuration file.

You can modify the ` MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS` parameter in ` configurations /  app_config .yaml` to set the maximum number concurrent task executions. This helps prevent resource exhaustion and maintain system performance under load. Proper load tests must implemented. It is required validate this setting

The ` LOG LEVEL` parameter also within ` configurations / app_config .yaml` governs verbosity logging. Setting to `DEBUG`, provides extensive information for debugging purposes. `INFO` is default value which balances detail and noise during normal operation and ` ERROR` minimizes logging. This optimizes the logs for monitoring purpose. Proper logging levels are vital for troubleshooting.

Custom task handlers should be configured via plugin directory located at `plugins/`. Place plugin modules within the plugins directory.  Subsequently configure them in ` configurations / task_plugins .yaml`. The file maps each task name to specific plugin handler class. This provides flexibility for custom integration. The engine now actively utilizes plugins.

TME' allows for custom event callbacks. Define event notification endpoints, providing URL endpoint. Configure callback URL, authentication method ( if required)  inside `/ events`. It facilitates communication T ME. Ensure callback endpoint accessible T ME for notifications. It's essential for real -time event processing. Proper event routing is also important.

## Project Structure ##
