The project is built as a backend API, allowing integration with frontend interfaces or other applications. It' is ideal for agile team work.

We are striving to build an application that is scalable and adaptable to different user and team workflows. Our system allows the users to set custom deadlines and reminders. Tempo is built with a focus on providing robust data persistence and ensuring a seamless and consistent end-user experience. We hope you will consider using and improving our software!  

Ultimately, Tempo is a productivity solution that aims to simplify workflows and increase overall team collaboration while being flexible to accommodate different use cases and team structures. The modular system design will ensure that it can be customized to meet your organization' s particular workflows, increasing flexibility and productivity while reducing the cost and complexity of tasks and their assignments.. The project is actively maintained and will be updated with new improvements.

This is a Python driven application with asynchronous messaging, ensuring maximum throughput for all requests and tasks. Tempo can be configured via environmental variables for deployment, making it easy to integrate into cloud deployments. This allows us to focus development on the user facing API, rather than worrying about infrastructure.

## Installation Instructions

Prerequisites to installing Tempo are Docker and a modern terminal environment (e .g. Bash, Zsh) that can run Docker commands.  A basic level of command- line comfort, including navigating directories.  It is highly suggested to use either MacOS or Linux as this project does not currently have a full testing and development suite for Windows operating system..

You must have Docker installed and running before proceeding, which enables us to run Tempo and its dependencies in container format which simplifies the deployment of tasks on multiple operating platforms and cloud environments, ensuring portability of services.. You can verify your Docker installation by running ` docker info`.  A message should appear with your Docker system information.

Clone the Tempo repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone <repository_url> 
cd Tempo
```
This retrieves all source code and related files needed for installation.  You need to replace `< repository_ url>` with the appropriate location for your Tempo software source.

Install Python dependencies within our development containers:

```bash
docker image build -t tempo-app .
```
 This command instructs Docker to build a Docker container with our app. This process downloads, compiles, and links the software dependencies needed by Tempo. 

After successful image build, launch the app:

```bash  
python -m tempo.app # Or any other entrypoint script
```

Ensure you have the `python` executable in your environment path. You may also need to specify the location for Tempo to access the environment if there is interference with any other software on the operating system.

If you encounter dependency issues, make sure the correct versions are installed and check for conflicting packages. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies if needed and resolve potential conflicts during the process.. It is possible to run this software using a Python container, but you will need some understanding of Docker for doing so. 

For Windows users, consider using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). This provides a Linux environment within your Windows OS for seamless development and deployment using Docker and other standard utilities..  Docker Desktop for Window should work, but may need some tweaking.  

The Tempo repository should now be ready for configuration and use.. You might want to run a few basic test commands before using production tasks for verification. The project is actively maintained and will be updated with new fixes and enhancements.  

## Usage Instructions

To launch the Tempo API, you can run:
```bash  
python -m tempo.app
```
or

```bash   
./run.sh # Example entrypoint
 ```

This initiates the main Tempo server, listening on port `8000`. You should verify this port is not used and is accessible. To access the Tempo API endpoints, you can use any REST client of your choice. Postman and curl are some popular alternatives.

To create a new task, send a POST to `/ tasks` with a payload in JSON format containing fields for `description (mandatory), due_date ( optional), and assigned_to (optional).` A success should return a 201 code and a newly assigned ID for future reference .

To retrieve all open tasks you can issue a GET request to `/ task`. A success should return a 200 with a JSON array. To query tasks based on a specific assignee, you can send a GET query on `/tasks?assign = {username}`

You can update a task's information with `PUT /tasks/{task_id}`. The response code should return 200 on success or 404 if the id could not be identified within the repository..  Use a JSON payload for any parameters that you are changing.

The API supports filtering by `status` ( open, in_progress, completed) and ` due date`. Example : `/task?status= open& due_date=&lt;date format&gt;` will return a list of all open task with the requested due- date. You can test this by creating a new task. 

For bulk operations ( e.g., updating all open tasks ), Tempo supports asynchronous job queue, which can be configured and enabled through environment variables..  The asynchronous job queue should be monitored for errors or stalled tasks and addressed promptly. 

To test the Tempo API you might want to write a series of automated integration tests with a Python framework and libraries such as ` pytest and requests`.  These tests should cover basic API operations to ensure the stability and correctness of the system.. This would allow users to test for any unexpected behavior before using production workflows.    

## Configuration

Tempo relies on configuration to control its behavior and connection to other system components.  All configuration parameters are available as environment variables for easy management in deployment environments.  These parameters allow you to adjust the Tempo server's functionality, database connection, logging level, etc .

The primary environment variable is  `DATABASE_URL` which should define the location for persistent data. By Default, Tempo utilizes SQLite which allows for a lightweight database, but it is encouraged to deploy with a dedicated PostgreSQL or MySQL instance for larger teams or applications.. The connection URL will vary according to your database type.

Another crucial environment variable is  `PORT` that defines how Tempo exposes it's API. A default port has been pre-configured to 8000. If you intend to deploy Tempo within a reverse-proxy or load balancer then you should configure this variable accordingly..

Logging is configured through the `LOG_LEVEL` variable, which can be set to `DEBUG ` for detailed information, `INFO` for general activity and `WARNING` or `ERROR ` for error messages, or `CRITICAL` for severe system errors.. The `LOG FILE` variable defines the path where log data is to be stored.

Additional parameters, such a number of worker thread for the asynchronous job queue, and API security keys, are available for advanced customization and security hardening..  These can be specified and configured on a per instance basis for greater security and efficiency..  Consult the documentation for a complete list of supported environment variables.  

The application will fall back to default settings if any of your configurations are not present.. However, it is highly recommended that you explicitly configure all environment variables to ensure consistent and predictable behavior across different deployment environments. Configuration parameters can be dynamically updated without requiring a redeployment, allowing for quick adjustments to Tempo without any interruptions .

You should regularly review your configuration settings to maintain optimal performance and security as you scale your Tempo application.. Consider automating configuration deployments as you grow your system, to streamline deployments. The Tempo team provides a full documentation of all configurable items.

## Acknowledgments

We express our gratitude to the open- source community for their valuable contributions and support.  We have leveraged several excellent libraries and open-source technologies.

Specifically, we appreciate the support from the Python ecosystem, including libraries like `Flask`, `SQLAlchemy ` and `pytest `.  We also acknowledge the contributions of the Docker team for creating a powerful and easy to use containerization technology.. This simplifies testing and the deployment. 

Our project relies on Docker's robust architecture, allowing users across platforms and cloud services to easily run, develop, and modify the code for Tempo with minimal effort.. Finally, thank you for considering to improve or support the Tempo system for all. 

## System Architecture

Tempo is designed with a microservice architecture centered around modular Python APIs for increased performance and adaptability to diverse deployment environments.. The key components comprise of task managers (REST endpoints exposed via flask for operations on Tasks ), an Asynchronous worker processes which handle the background processes ( like sending of email notifications ). These modules connect to databases utilizing ORMs such as ` SQLAlchemy`.

We employ a publish- subscribe ( pub- sub ) system that allows for intercommunication among Tempo service to manage asynchronous processing. For database connectivity, the team prefers Postgress due to it reliability and feature robustness . All of these systems interact within a well- structured and modular environment allowing flexibility and extensibility. 

Communication between microservices happens asynchronously by sending events. This approach ensures low- latency operations and high resilience . The system uses environment variable for configurable deployment on different cloud instances with different scaling needs . A centralized Logging System aggregates the processes.

Furthermore, we have built in caching layers, to prevent database reads on the most accessed data which ensures maximum scalability for the software . This will keep performance optimized during scaling and large- load requests . This approach helps ensure efficient performance across diverse deployment configurations, promoting resilience to failure in any system. 

## API Reference

The Tempo API exposes the REST- ful service to manage and process various task operations: 

`/tasks` supports all operations.  A `GET`/ `tasks` request provides information regarding currently open tasks assigned across different groups.. POST to `/tasks` allows the user to register the new assignments to users with specific task description .

To retrieve one specific entry use `/tasks/{ task id}` for both reading information regarding specific entry as well GETing and UPDATING specific assignments using a POST request for updating information regarding specific users . 

All POST request require a minimum of `description, assign to` fields for creation or updating entries, but may support extra data as desired and necessary, such as due date . Responses from any call to these endpoints include standard JSON formatted information pertaining task creation success , errors or failures. A `status = 200 OK` means success while 404 will return not found if a requested assignment has already disappeared

A `PUT `/task/ update assignee, change deadlines or change task descriptions, with `400 errors on failed submissions. For example POST / Tasks, with `assignee` and a brief description for new tasks to add..  GET `/ task` retrieves existing lists to manage. POST to update with PUT to modify the information to keep all processes efficient.. This modular API architecture facilitates integrations into various client side platforms to increase utilization for users and improve overall workflows for teams to work together and collaborate effectively.. 

## Testing

Testing is a fundamental component in building the robustness and scalability. We have adopted the pytest for the majority of the automated code, but there are several integrations of different types . Our tests consist of Unit test for each of components for isolated functionality to be independently confirmed and tested with various inputs, along side the end to end system testing to validate interoperation.  A continuous integration is implemented and triggered for each Pull Requests for testing on various branches and configurations to avoid breaking of builds .

We provide test configuration to enable easy running and configuration in any operating system for testing.. We encourage contributors to provide new Unit and integrations with the existing codebase for any improvements that is implemented towards existing codebase or for new additions.  You need to verify these with our existing testing frameworks to guarantee compatibility, which can prevent breaking issues when new releases happen and can provide more stable environments

 To Run test locally you need a pytest install on environment: 
 ```python  
 pip install pytest 
 pytest 
 ```
 To check if any changes will affect build quality please verify the existing testing frameworks and provide a testing suite .   This allows our software engineering staff the ease of testing new additions while keeping stability and robustness for end consumers.

## Troubleshooting

If you face issues while installation ensure to double- check that your docker has a stable build that meets your hardware configuration requirements . The `port conflict error` might show that a process running is conflicting and you have two solutions for that - kill it, move to new process and/or move ports

Database connection failure can often result due to wrong username , incorrect path and/or database credentials, Verify credentials. Check if a port has conflicts and move the service . 

A general issue you may run into are environment config issues that cause runtime exception, review your environment configurations, or consult with our official Tempo document on deployment guidelines that provide step by step solutions and tips that could potentially fix these problems, .

To check on any dependencies issues that might result into an error check that each module has all correct dependency installed in each environments with compatible Python and libraries installed on environment.. 

For all of your concerns refer to our Github page and report a potential bug or issues .   This can resolve the majority of runtime errors or configuration related challenges with minimal delay, ensuring users and stakeholders experience an optimal software deployment experience, .

## Performance and Optimization

For enhanced scalability performance and stability we are leveraging asynchronous worker tasks.  These workers are built and maintained to handle large operations to near- instantaneously process background events like emails and database maintenance.. To further increase efficiency our database queries will cache frequently requested and utilized tasks for greater responsiveness for consumers . 
   
To monitor resource utilizations we recommend utilizing system resource profiler, which allows us to understand the bottleneck in system resource allocations to further increase stability.

For heavier deployments with large amounts of data consider utilizing the PubSub for asynchronous communication which allows decoupling for faster task processing with minimal dependencies..  To achieve faster database read/ writes we have implemented the indexing on frequently used columns for increased throughput and responsiveness.. We continue researching techniques of leveraging the system computers resources with more efficiency as our code is further developed, and optimized .  

## Security Considerations

The safety of your user information must always remain a paramount objective for the entire project.. For all API interactions Tempo implements HTTP secure for all connections and data exchange between users .  For sensitive environment information such data as credentials should reside on secured vault that can rotate secrets periodically to reduce chances for unauthorized data surprises .

Tempo is built by validating every form data that is coming, ensuring it does not include injection scripts such malware and SQL queries, as these will prevent data compromise or unauthorized database modification and attacks .  Regular auditing for events is implemented as an automatic security system to help catch malicious behavior as quickly as possible , which prevents unauthorized attacks and intrusions..
All new contributors will sign a NDA with our software project . .  
  Security updates from Tempo and any related open-source technologies and software are implemented to minimize vulnerability. .  Please refer to Tempo Security Guide that includes all information that ensures data stays confidential for end consumers and team . .

## Roadmap

Current development priorities consist of adding integration with external project tracking platforms like Trello, Asana, or Jira for increased team integration and ease-of use across platforms for consumers to easily adopt our product into the workplace .

Next steps for Tempo is developing a Role Based access- control that is more advanced that will allow teams more options of how their permissions work across multiple projects to ensure data confidentiality. 
We have been prioritizing improving Tempo with an enhanced dashboard which would show performance of various projects in one convenient view that allows managers greater efficiency, . 
The future roadmap for Tempo consists on incorporating support of new data bases that could improve database connectivity to meet different use- cases, . Finally for Q3/2024 , it has plans of developing a CLI and a desktop GUI to make the Tempo more available and versatile in various platforms , to make it available on various systems for different consumer types .
