## Installation Instructions

First, you'll need to ensure you meet the project prerequisites: a C ++ 17 compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC), Qt 6.x development libraries, and CMake build system. It' s best to have a development environment set up before you install.

To begin, clone repository from the Git repository using the following:
```bash
git clone https:// github.com/ your-organization/ securevault- pro # Replace with your repository URL
cd securevault- pro
 ```

Next, ensure you've installed Qt 6 with the necessary modules for C++ development. This often involves using your platform specific package manager:
```bash
# Example using apt on Debian/Ubuntu
 apt- get install qt6- base-dev qt6- gui  qt6- network- dev
 ``` 

Create a separate build directory within the project' s root to organize your build artifacts. This keeps the main source directories clean and avoids clutter:
```bash
 mkdir build
 cd build
 ```

Then, execute CMake to configure the project. Provide the path to your Qt 6 installation if not auto- detected:
```bash
 cmake - DQT_QTA_IMPORT_PATH=/path/ to/ Qt6/ libraries . # Replace with Qt path if required
 ```

The build will often produce errors due to Qt versions mismatch or if Qt isn t installed appropriately so, it can take time and troubleshooting is necessary if issues arise. The CMake script analyzes the environment to determine dependencies so that it's important that they all present themselves appropriately for building the executable

Build your installation project with `make`. The compilation step transforms the C++ source code and associated files into compiled code. It also generates necessary binary executables, and other artifacts for distribution, allowing SecureVault Pro executable file ready for installation .
```bash
 make
 ```

After `make`, Install by executing this simple instruction, this places compiled program, necessary resources into designated location
```bash
 make install
 ```

On Windows, you can substitute `make` and `make install` with `nmake` if using MSVC as a compiler.

Finally, the program files for installation reside typically into the specified location which is: /opt/securevault or, in windows, the application is present inside "program files." Verify successful compilation to run SecureVaultPro by inspecting its directory location or by running a diagnostic tool from your shell/terminal to find the location

## Usage Instructions

Upon successful installation, locate the SecureVault Pro executable from the applications directory for you system. It is generally installed in "program files." The executable name is SecureVaultPro, which runs the initial application start screen for the app..

Create your profile by selecting a secure encryption password that's difficult to guess while ensuring the storage of keys.  
A longer more unpredictable password enhances robustness so you will always have opportunity of creating stronger ones . The SecureVaultPro application requires minimum key lengths for encryption purposes to avoid possible compromise scenarios so ensure your password is at least sixteen digits and complex for security reasons. 

The first step to encryption would be choosing to import your folders by right- clicking on an encrypted location in your file systems explorer to encrypt and import into Securevault and follow all of the initial messages displayed from application and confirm the selection for import of all your file folders. It takes only a small duration, dependent on files volume so you don not want it interrupted during import

Utilizing secure message is straightforward, create messages by typing directly and setting your desired encrypted receivers with appropriate contact so your messaging will always reach desired individuals, and they have proper authentication.  The encrypted text becomes unintelligible outside secure communication network

When creating messages for others to read ensure all users in network follow all the steps outlined previously or the messages will become illegible as encrypted files. If users follow protocol and use correct settings messages would remain readable until decryption occurs. The encrypted messaging protocol uses unique authentication codes so only users within encrypted networks receive communications

The file decryption process mirrors file encryption, simply selecting a directory or individual files that requires to decryption for normal accessibility from user interface so decryption happens without requiring code- level manipulation to the SecureVault app interface. Securevault will request password, so the app decrypt files as instructed from its user interface..

For bulk encrypt or decrypt file sets you would need batch mode. Use terminal `--batch-- import / directory path and similar arguments and instructions on application help file

## Configuration 

SecureVault Pro stores encryption keys in a securely managed key vault which prevents external access. Key vaults can have various settings like auto backups for protection, or even multi key protection which ensures that the encryption process isn secure at the deepest most secure levels possible. The keys vaults will be created on first use but the vault path must remain the same, because keys cannot be easily ported across multiple vaults

To change application look feel you need configure `style-sheets`, these `stylesheet-sheets ` control overall visual aspects from application. `themes`.xml allows user customizing color schemes and font choices, allowing the interface align your user aesthetic preferences and needs to create user interface experience you require to maximize efficiency . This will affect all of application and its modules.
For enhanced configuration of program security settings like logging you should look at logging settings, located in program' configuration folder under log- levels which controls level detailed messages logged for diagnostic analysis in program and system level.
If a configuration requires changes it' s recommended restart secure vault program so any setting will become fully implemented . The application does automatically update these when the app launches after configuration

Custom password salts enhance key integrity. SecureVault allows customization salt settings through `config.yaml`.  Modify values within configuration YAML.  Ensure to maintain secure randomness. Incorrect configurations render system vulnerable; thus review carefully prior any changes.

User profiles, stored as encrypted containers contain preferences and access levels to files, so the application remembers settings across multiple instances to guarantee personalized use. The application is also designed to integrate system notification services.
Using the application in a system requires user to configure access level so they understand their rights in system access

## Project Structure

The core of the SecureVault project rests primarily with `/src` which holds source C ++ Code, defining logic that manages security and UI operations for program to achieve objectives . The files under include all C ++ implementation, and supporting data structure to enable secure storage.

Within `/include`, all public C++ code are placed so any third-party applications would require it in a secure implementation.

`tests/` houses our suite to examine functionality and integrity and to maintain stability through rigorous validation tests and quality control to make it reliable, ensuring consistent performance over diverse use circumstances, which validates core program capabilities,

`/configs/` directory is home configurations like YAML, and style sheet which controls behavior for various aspects for application to work as designed

A dedicated resource directory `res/` stores images assets which is used application icons or user interface graphics and themes, enhancing application appearance. It includes localization for translation and user preferences so international community has ability access

Finally build system instructions contain `CMakeLists.txt`, which is central file for project and it carries the configuration of project to allow us to create compilation and installation for program, using standard tool for building software

Dataflow proceeds securely and reliably. This modular architecture allows us for scalability and resilience for long time support



## API Reference

The main function is encryption. The input would have file directory as well password as argument to secure Vault API .

Encryption is implemented via a `VaultSecure` object in main C++ codebase
 `void EncryptFiles(VaultSecure &instance, Directory fileLocation)` . The main method accepts `Directory location` object and instance. 

It would use internal `EncryptFile function that accepts `filename as input, it then encrypt using key management object .
 * The encryption returns success if all operations performed without issues, failure indicates possibility errors. Error will also include description so that developers could understand the cause, allowing debugging if necessary
  API also exposes functions for retrieving information like key storage details using `keyManagement().storagePath ()`.
 API is protected using OAuth, with multi -level protection and user validation, it is designed for safety

Decryption functions use mirror functionality to enable retrieval original form from encryption, which provides seamless and user access for data recovery as and where need. Details would vary by case scenario to enable seamless modern access . It's all integrated in C++ with secure and easy use functions



## Testing

We run unit and system testing for code coverage . Testing setups require mock data set which allows isolating various features without relying system dependency

The unit- tests examine isolated features like encryption, file manipulation with appropriate data input, assessing if the core functions function as expected and produce anticipated output, allowing quick validation without integration challenges .  Unit Tests will also run in continuous development

The system Tests verify overall functionality, and interactions within entire program . System test run by using automated framework. We use testing for regression tests that validates no functionality gets impacted as we make modifications or new releases
 To trigger testing use the instruction below :

```bash
 python tests/tests .py  # For example if tests implemented on `Pytest` 
```

For CI testing, triggers automatically includes integration of automated test framework and continuous builds on various branches for code stability and security assurance
It runs automated security scanning. It' is also part the pipeline for quality check and release process.




## Troubleshooting

Common errors encountered involve Qt version incompatibility so verify the Qt installed on systems.

Issues regarding file permission may also occur during decryption process due encryption files may require appropriate system level rights .

Ensure the encryption process completed and key management is accessible. Incorrect file or paths are also a cause to issues with failed attempts, confirm directory and key management locations

Configuration issues often manifest as runtime errors and incorrect configurations, which should always reviewed carefully and ensure settings adhere project standard to maintain system function

When the application hangs unexpectedly or freezes. Review logging details, for possible clues about internal states of system so issues will be quickly detected with detailed analysis, to improve the user workflow

To solve dependencies either upgrade them and follow dependency management instruction, use a dependency conflict tool for review
Report any unusual behavior or bugs via GitHub repository so our contributors will quickly investigate for improvement to secureVault
