# Smart Home Automation Platform - "Aether"

## Overview and Purpose

Welcome to the Aether, a comprehensive open-source platform built to bring automation, monitoring and intelligent decision making into homes. Its designed around a modular, event driven system allowing flexible integrations between sensors, actuators and online service integrations (cloud platforms, smart home providers and more ). It aims to simplify creating custom rules to automate various smart- home processes based on time conditions, sensor data, location and user activity.

The Aether's architecture focuses heavily on local event processing reducing reliance on external service cloud connectivity improving reliability, privacy, and latency. A key goal involves offering a highly configurable user interface (UI) for rule creation and real- time device status overview, accessible from various devices (desktops, smart devices) allowing intuitive management. A comprehensive logging mechanism is provided, supporting both detailed system monitoring and debugging efforts

This project provides an alternative to the proprietary closed ecosystem found within commercial platforms, and offers a more transparent, open, customizable and cost - beneficial alternative, empowering individuals. The project is designed and architected with the intention of being extensible, with community support enabling a rich and evolving set of devices, features, integrations, and use cases. The platform will continue evolving, based upon the feedback of the user communities it serves.

Aether is intended to be a platform that can be customized, extended, and modified. Aether's event- driven design, and well documented API enables users to create their custom device integrations using various scripting methods, and languages. Aether will continue to expand its capabilities with more integrations, automation, monitoring, and user customization. The modular and configurable design of Aether allows it to be adapted to a variety of different home setups, and smart- home needs.

The project is built using Python 3, and relies on open source technology. Our commitment involves fostering a welcoming and productive community, where individuals can contribute, learn from their experiences,  and shape the platform according to their needs, and interests while adhering to a set set of coding standards and best practices,

## Installation Instructions

The first step is installing prerequisites including python environment, dependencies, and a local build system. You can download these dependencies from official channels. The system requirements are a computer, with access to network services as the application will use cloud connectivity, a python 3 interpreter, and a terminal or shell for command executions. Ensure your computer is properly setup and that the python and terminal tools you will be using can interact seamlessly together.

You can then download the installation script, using your favorite terminal, by cloning the git repo or downloading it as an zip.  Make sure to extract the downloaded file, and navigate into the main installation folder to run any setup instructions contained. Ensure your computer or device has the appropriate read and access permissions before executing setup and configuration instructions.

Before starting, please check Python and pip installed. To check your Python installation, run ` python --version ` in terminal . If it' not installed or the version is below python3, download the official installer. Next, verify pip, using `pip--version `. If it' not installed, install it via ` sudo apt install python3-pip  ` or use the instructions on the pip website, for your specific operating environment. Make sure, after this step that these are working properly before proceeding,

You will need to install several Python packages using `pip `. The main requirement for setting up the core functionality of the automation and monitoring features will include libraries like `requests, schedule and paho-mqtt `, among others . Open terminal and run : `pip install  --upgrade pip`, after installing, you will need to run :  `pip install --no-cache -dir requests, scheduling, paho -mqtt` to install necessary components, and dependencies that A ether runs on. This can take a while.

On Debian/Ubuntu Linux, install the required system dependencies with:
```bash
sudo apt- get  update
sudo apt- get install build essential python3- dev
sudo apt update
```
On macOS, it is recommended to use Homebrew: `brew install python3 build-ess ential python`. For Windows, install the Python distribution with development tools, or the equivalent package manager. After installation, you will likely need to restart you shell for the required environment variables to load

Next, you should clone the Aether repository using `git`. This allows tracking of future updates for the platform as you use it.
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AetherSmartHome/Aether.git
  cd A ether  # Move directory to the new installation folder after cloning is complete
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory. This directory contains all required resources. Create the virtual envi ron ment using the `pip  env ` module.
```bash
  pip3  install venv
  python3   -mvenv env
  source env/bin/activate # Activate enviro n ment on Linux or macOS . On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate `.
```
The environment isolates the packages installed, and prevents conflicts. Once this step finishes successfully, all dependencies will be ready to launch A ether platform.

## Usage Instructions 

Once the platform is running locally, the UI can be accessed in a web browser, using a local address, for exmaple `localhost: 5000`. After opening up a browser, the platform should load, and a user login can be completed. Aether comes with a few sample rules and sensor setups which will allow users to start experimenting with the platform.  These rules and sensor setups should appear within the UI, which can then be edited to change the automation behavior, to customize to user requirements.

To create a basic rule, you must specify triggers ( events which will trigger the execution of a specific rule) and action sequences, which define the steps the platform will take following a trigger, such as turning on or off an electrical device, sending an email alert, sending an SMS, logging data, etc. The UI allows the creation of triggers based on a multitude of factors: time, sensor data, user location, etc.

To test rule triggering with sensors, connect a compatible temperature sensor device to the platform and ensure this appears in a UI listing of active sensor devices. The user can then configure a trigger based on a specific temperature reading. This will cause actions associated with that rule to be automatically executed, providing real time confirmation. This provides real time visual indication, that the platform can react appropriately to events within the smart home system.

For a more advanced usage you could create a rule which sends a push notification when a person enters or leaves the property, based on a geolocation of the user phone device. This requires integration with a push service, to send the notifications, but is a very practical real world application for a smart home automation platform, and a very powerful demonstration. This will also show how the Aether can integrate with external services and cloud connectivity, as the push service can be a 

The API also facilitates automated scripting, or external integrations. You can access endpoints via ` http://localhost: 5000 ` (adjust based on your local server setup ) and authenticate as necessary to interact with the core components of this automation framework,

Aether also has a logging system, providing insights into event and execution flows. This will help troubleshoot any issues encountered, by reviewing logs from device integrations and automation rule triggering. Logs help debug and ensure the platform is operating smoothly

## Configuration

Aether can be configured through a configuration file, which defines global settings, API keys and sensor integrations to the platform. This ` configuration.yaml ` file, can be found in the configuration directory, and is used to specify external integrations and device configurations that will be used by the smart automation system . This file contains various parameters to define the operation of the platform.

The ` configuration.yaml ` allows defining API keys for cloud integrations such as weather services, and push notifications. Each API key should be obtained from respective provider and securely placed in this configuration file. The `configuration.yaml ` file also specifies the MQTT broker settings. These include broker address, port, and user credential which allows the platform to connect to external MQTT services, for sensor and actuator device communication.

Aether's environment variables control various runtime behaviors like logging verbosity, debug mode, or API keys which may be sensitive. These environment variables, can be set within your host system or using a `.env ` file to configure specific variables like logging level, API keys, and external service connections, which are used to customize the system without directly modifying the configuration file,

The logging level in the ` configuration.yaml ` file, can be configured, to determine the amount of detailed information, logged by the automation platform. Higher logging level, such as ` DEBUG  ` will provide a more detailed insight into the internal processes, however, can generate a very substantial log file which may be overwhelming. The `logging  ` level provides detailed logs for all activities while the `INFO  ` log level only records important information which helps to optimize disk,

You can also customize the UI theme, and visual style through the ` configuration.yaml ` file, allowing a more personalized user experience, that matches the aesthetics of the smart home,

The ` security ` section in the ` configuration.yaml ` config file, can be used to define security settings which includes password encryption, user authorization policies and other access control configurations which are used to restrict unauthorized access or data manipulation,

## Project Structure

The Aether project is structured to encourage modularity, code reusability, and maintainability, following established software engineering best practice. The main source files are within the `src ` directory, which contains core components of the platform. The ` configs ` directory stores configuration related files, like ` configuration.yaml ` used for setting up and customization of the A ether platform.

The ` tests ` directory houses a comprehensive suite of unit tests, integrating, and end to end functional test to verify the stability of the core components, and ensure the automation platform functions as per expected behaviors. The ` scripts  ` folder contains various auxiliary scripts, used for deployment or automation purposes, simplifying setup, installation procedures,

The `docs` contains documentation files, including this readme, API documentation, and other user guidance materials, providing clear information, for users, contributors, and developers alike. The `venv ` directory stores the Python virtual environment, isolating the dependencies from your system environment, ensuring consistency,

The root `requirements.txt ` file lists all the dependencies that A ether project relies on, facilitating easy installation of all necessary Python packages, for consistent and repeatable deployments,

The ` logs ` directory is reserved for log files, where system operations and event data are recorded, providing valuable data insights for debugging, monitoring performance,

A `Dockerfile ` exists to containerize the application, enabling easy deployment and portability across different environments, and operating systems,

The development of Aether has been heavily influenced by several key projects and contributors from across open-source community, for whose inspiration we give due recognition. Firstly we extend appreciation towards MIT libraries used as core building blocks which provided efficient frameworks and functionalities for our application development . The Python ecosystem as a whole, offers robust and reliable programming tool which have played crucial support for development

Furthermore we are deeply appreciative and extend recognition for MQTT, a robust publish - subscribe message-based protocol used by this application that has facilitated device communication . The open smart home project community have given valuable insight in building automation tools for modern homes. This has been essential guidance on user-centric development

We want to give thanks for contributors whose expertise and code samples provided inspiration on building this framework as open and customizable platform and extend appreciation to all who contributed in this effort to empower others. We are open to all community contributions

## System Architecture

The core Aether framework revolves around event driven architecture with components that interact via publish subscribe mechanisms for high efficiency modular communication between components. Sensors report readings or events and Actuators receive signals which triggers a device actions in a timely way and user defined triggers, such events that execute automation rule sequence or notification.  All interactions pass the central automation rule processor.

This component monitors triggers events and then runs rule based conditions and action, which dictates automation execution path and sequence, which allows for highly dynamic, home control scenarios that adapt based conditions

There is also UI service providing visual control for users via the platform and API services exposing core functions which enable external automation or custom scripts for more extensive system customization which facilitates flexible, automated system integration for all types user needs, from beginners through advanced users, with custom automations and control options .  Database layer storing state data such configurations sensor and recent history which is essential for persistence in the application

A dedicated communication module connects sensors via standard protocol for IoT such, with the core engine. A cloud connection component forwards external APIs connectivity for integrations. These are key architectural design principles in which this smart automation system is implemented and functions with ease . These modules are tightly inter - connected for greater modularization of application features with a single core

## API Reference

The Aether platform's API facilitates interaction with various modules via standardized interface endpoints for programmatic access control for advanced users with automated integrations for their smart systems . API documentation is automatically built via `Swagger`, which outlines each method and its parameters. Authentication requires token generation which are obtained through the API documentation for authentication access . The primary route is: `/ api /`, with several nested subpaths to manage devices. 

For sensor reading requests , a GET request must target `/ api/ sensors  `, passing the sensors unique name, and a request will then provide real time sensor values with appropriate formatting,

Device state update requests target a route called /api/device-update . To perform state modification the request payload requires unique sensor identification with target device states as key value pairings

The rule manager endpoint at /api/ rules  supports creation modification of automations. The request payloads are in the `JSON` and follow specified structure outlined through detailed document documentation for applying different triggers to specific devices for various events which enables dynamic, automation workflows which allow user customized behavior in time, or sensor data . API is fully secured to provide authentication authorization. For detailed documentation visit:  http://aether . smart/ docs/ API/.
For more complex scenarios such integration of 3rd- party API calls, or extensive sensor integrations , Aether also provides Python API which are provided through a module, and a well-documented framework, with full examples, available in Github, 

## Testing

Thorough and reliable tests ensure the long- term maintainability, quality and correct function for automation and platform, allowing developers and end user confidence. This platform relies primarily with automated Python Unit-Testing integrated via Pytest . A test framework provides robust framework that covers multiple functional integrations for device connectivity, data management, rule evaluation. Testing runs upon a code-commit, with continuous Integration. 

To perform testing of platform, the testing environment is involved and set- up by the developer, for local execution, using a local testing tool or a containerization approach. You can trigger automated tests with: ` python3   -m pytest -v ` in the root source file location within `testing directory ` for detailed status, output. To verify connectivity and sensor readability the `Mock-sensor class allows to easily verify functionality and rule processing with defined conditions to allow automated integration, which provides comprehensive automated platform testability
Testing also covers security and vulnerability analysis

## Troubleshooting

One of the frequent initial issues when launching a local Aether instance revolves around missing python environment configurations.  Double checking you correctly initialized environment, as mentioned within setup instruction will often resolve. Another is incorrect `config  file` settings and syntax highlighting, and formatting errors, are often reported, ensure that you follow guidelines closely

Connectivity to a specific broker is not possible: check security, network and broker connection to make ensure connection. MQTT authentication failures are the source to verify correct login credentials within broker. A failure of the application server or API to respond can mean resource starvation of memory.

Error log is consistently populated which shows repeated error which doesn;t appear within user console interface: check permissions within directories or ensure logs can write appropriately in file- based systems,

Device discovery failure is another frequent issues with a particular brand and device:  Ensure you installed the relevant integrations within Aether, and that you configured your API properly and are connected, for seamless and stable connectivity

Incorrect configuration in rules leads automation acting contrary expected states and functions and causing unintended automation: Double - check the conditional expressions within rules with accurate trigger logic which prevents unexpected behaviour in automation processes

## Performance and Optimization

Performance optimization involves several areas within smart home ecosystem. The first, and important step would reduce latency of device connections via utilizing fast network connections for all integrations as possible,

Cache sensor, device information which improves rule engine responsiveness by limiting API queries. This allows platform to function faster without constantly retrieving data which improves responsiveness, and lowers system overhead, 

Implement background threads with concurrent process to evaluate multiple automation routines simultaneously . By executing rules concurrently the platform avoids delays in automation, and can react more efficiently for complex event triggers in system automation scenarios,

Profile resource, use cases of platform using built in profiling tool and identify areas for potential bottlenecks. By monitoring key resource, usage can improve resource and efficiency and reduce unnecessary system resource allocation which reduces resource overhead . The application is optimized using modern coding standards that ensure high levels efficient and maintainable code. A cache management can provide improved platform response with optimized caching, as discussed before

## Security Considerations

Aether platform requires security measures which ensures that it remains resilient, safe against cyber security and vulnerabilities from various adverse sources in an environment

All configurations files containing sensitive data must always encrypted to prevent any potential compromise. A password policy is in use and regularly monitored that mandates a complexity to ensure secure user authentication access control within platform
User data should adhere to standard encryption protocols and data restrictions. Minimization and masking of important sensitive details within configuration and storage should occur

All third party libraries should stay update and monitored for potential vulnerability. Patch all software regularly that includes Aether itself and its dependencies with security updates . All communication channels use strong encrypted protocols TLS or SSH which prevent unauthorized intercept.

All access attempts, including login and actions will always monitored with a central, audit logging which helps trace unauthorized or suspect events which enables proactive monitoring of suspicious system behaviours .These logging events facilitates proactive threat mitigation with detailed event audit history
Vulnerability assessments can reveal weak point for attackers

## Roadmap

Currently, the platform has support to primary MQTT and WiFi enabled array of sensor, actuator components. In near time a Bluetooth sensor connectivity and cloud platform ( AWS ,Azure) integration, which enhances device integration support

We will develop an expanded rule management tool allowing user - customized rule templates that can easily share rule logic and create customized rules for automation workflows with advanced conditional expression
Improved User interfaces ( UI), with more intuitive design for easier use, personalized dashboards for quick device overview, and automation controls which simplifies automation management and monitoring .

Future plans will implement advanced anomaly detections based, upon real data analysis using historical trend through ML which allows to create adaptive rule sets. A machine vision and computer- vision module, which uses AI to understand environment context through integrated camera which expands functionality and automation use scenarios. We expect an expanded device compatibility and more integration in coming iterations and improvements to our open community project
Finally a comprehensive API is foreseen and fully supported
