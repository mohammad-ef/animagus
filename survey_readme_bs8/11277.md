**Tempo** is a task and productivity tool built for managing and prioritizing tasks, facilitating team communication and enhancing workflow.  It aims to address the challenges of modern workplaces by enabling efficient task organization with detailed tracking. This system is suitable to use as a replacement for existing solutions, but is also modular and can be integrated into other software platforms to add functionality or extend its usage.

This system focuses on a modular and extensible microservice design using Python and Docker which simplifies the deployment of tasks on multiple operating platforms and cloud environments, ensuring portability of services. Its key functionality encompasses creation and prioritization and assignment of tasks and their dependencies, and progress reporting. The project is built as a backend API, allowing integration with frontend interfaces or other applications. It' is ideal for agile team work.

We are striving to build an application that is scalable and adaptable to different user and team workflows. Our system allows the users to set custom deadlines and reminders. Tempo is built with a focus on providing robust data persistence and ensuring a seamless and consistent end-user experience. We hope you will consider using and improving our software!  

Ultimately, Tempo is a productivity solution that aims to simplify workflows and increase overall team collaboration while being flexible to accommodate different use cases and team structures. The modular system design will ensure that it can be customized to meet your organization' s particular workflows, increasing flexibility and productivity while reducing the cost and complexity of tasks and their assignments.. The project is actively maintained and will be updated with new improvements.

This is a Python driven application with asynchronous messaging, ensuring maximum throughput for all requests and tasks. Tempo can be configured via environmental variables for deployment, making it easy to integrate into cloud deployments. This allows us to focus development on the user facing API, rather than worrying about infrastructure.

## Installation Instructions

Prerequisites to installing Tempo are Docker and a modern terminal environment (e .g. Bash, Zsh) that can run Docker commands.  A basic level of command- line comfort, including navigating directories.  It is highly suggested to use either MacOS or Linux as this project does not currently have a full testing and development suite for Windows operating system..

You must have Docker installed and running before proceeding, which enables us to run Tempo and its dependencies in container format which simplifies the deployment of tasks on multiple operating platforms and cloud environments, ensuring portability of services.. You can verify your Docker installation by running ` docker info`.  A message should appear with your Docker system information.

Clone the Tempo repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone <repository_url> 
cd Tempo
```
This retrieves all source code and related files needed for installation.  You need to replace `< repository_ url>` with the appropriate location for your Tempo software source.

Install Python dependencies within our development containers:

```bash
docker image build -t tempo-app .
```
 This command instructs Docker to build a Docker container with our app. This process downloads, compiles, and links the software dependencies needed by Tempo. 

After successful image build, launch the app:

```bash  
python -m tempo.app # Or any other entrypoint script
```

Ensure you have the `python` executable in your environment path. You may also need to specify the location for Tempo to access the environment if there is interference with any other software on the operating system.

If you encounter dependency issues, make sure the correct versions are installed and check for conflicting packages. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies if needed and resolve potential conflicts during the process.. It is possible to run this software using a Python container, but you will need some understanding of Docker for doing so. 

For Windows users, consider using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). This provides a Linux environment within your Windows OS for seamless development and deployment using Docker and other standard utilities..  Docker Desktop for Window should work, but may need some tweaking.  

The Tempo repository should now be ready for configuration and use.. You might want to run a few basic test commands before using production tasks for verification. The project is actively maintained and will be updated with new fixes and enhancements.  

## Usage Instructions

To launch the Tempo API, you can run:
```bash  
python -m tempo.app
```
or

```bash   
./run.sh # Example entrypoint
 ```

This initiates the main Tempo server, listening on port `8000`. You should verify this port is not used and is accessible. To access the Tempo API endpoints, you can use any REST client of your choice. Postman and curl are some popular alternatives.

To create a new task, send a POST to `/ tasks` with a payload in JSON format containing fields for `description (mandatory), due_date ( optional), and assigned_to (optional).` A success should return a 201 code and a newly assigned ID for future reference .

To retrieve all open tasks you can issue a GET request to `/ task`. A success should return a 200 with a JSON array. To query tasks based on a specific assignee, you can send a GET query on `/tasks?assign = {username}`

You can update a task's information with `PUT /tasks/{task_id}`. The response code should return 200 on success or 404 if the id could not be identified within the repository..  Use a JSON payload for any parameters that you are changing.

The API supports filtering by `status` ( open, in_progress, completed) and ` due date`. Example : `/task?status= open& due_date=&lt;date format&gt;` will return a list of all open task with the requested due- date. You can test this by creating a new task. 

For bulk operations ( e.g., updating all open tasks ), Tempo supports asynchronous job queue, which can be configured and enabled through environment variables..  The asynchronous job queue should be monitored for errors or stalled tasks and addressed promptly. 

To test the Tempo API you might want to write a series of automated integration tests with a Python framework and libraries such as ` pytest and requests`.  These tests should cover basic API operations to ensure the stability and correctness of the system.. This would allow users to test for any unexpected behavior before using production workflows.    

## Configuration

Tempo relies on configuration to control its behavior and connection to other system components.  All configuration parameters are available as environment variables for easy management in deployment environments.  These parameters allow you to adjust the Tempo server's functionality, database connection, logging level, etc .

The primary environment variable is  `DATABASE_URL` which should define the location for persistent data. By Default, Tempo utilizes SQLite which allows for a lightweight database, but it is encouraged to deploy with a dedicated PostgreSQL or MySQL instance for larger teams or applications.. The connection URL will vary according to your database type.

Another crucial environment variable is  `PORT` that defines how Tempo exposes it's API. A default port has been pre-configured to 8000. If you intend to deploy Tempo within a reverse-proxy or load balancer then you should configure this variable accordingly..

Logging is configured through the `LOG_LEVEL` variable, which can be set to `DEBUG ` for detailed information, `INFO` for general activity and `WARNING` or `ERROR ` for error messages, or `CRITICAL` for severe system errors.. The `LOG FILE` variable defines the path where log data is to be stored.

Additional parameters, such a number of worker thread for the asynchronous job queue, and API security keys, are available for advanced customization and security hardening..  These can be specified and configured on a per instance basis for greater security and efficiency..  Consult the documentation for a complete list of supported environment variables.  

The application will fall back to default settings if any of your configurations are not present.. However, it is highly recommended that you explicitly configure all environment variables to ensure consistent and predictable behavior across different deployment environments. Configuration parameters can be dynamically updated without requiring a redeployment, allowing for quick adjustments to Tempo without any interruptions .

You should regularly review your configuration settings to maintain optimal performance and security as you scale your Tempo application.. Consider automating configuration deployments as you grow your system, to streamline deployments. The Tempo team provides a full documentation of all configurable items.

## System Architecture

Tempo employs a microservices architecture consisting of three key components. This structure enables horizontal scaling, fault tolerance, and easier maintainance as your system expands.. It's built on asynchronous eventing patterns allowing for efficient communication and processing

*   **API Gateway:** Serves as the entry point to the Tempo application. Responsible for request routing, authentication, and authorization. Built on top of a fast, efficient REST web-service framework .
*   **Task Manager Service:** Manages all task related functionalities: creating, updating, assigning and querying..
*   **Message Queue ( Redis by default ):** Acts as the broker of communication among components..  

These three microservices run as separate containers within a Docker cluster for easy deployments. All of this allows it to adapt rapidly, ensuring efficient performance. Data is persistently stored within the chosen backend storage system such as, but not exclusive to: PostgreSQL.   Data consistency across different components is managed via an idempotent event queue for reliability, even after service reboots .  Tempo leverages message queue technology and is driven asynchronously by workers which are designed to minimize API call latency while still allowing efficient execution of asynchronous processes.  

## API Reference

The Tempo API follows RESTful principles. All endpoints begin with `/ tasks `.  We strive to keep this interface intuitive and consistent across different API clients. Here is an overview.

*   **`POST /tasks`**:  Creates a new task. Expects JSON payload `description, due_date (optional), assigned_to (optional)`.
*   **`GET /tasks`**:  Returns all open tasks, can also be sorted with filters for specific users/assignees .  Parameters include `assign_to `( optional filter), and  ` status` (open, completed, in progress), or due date filters
*    **`GET /tasks/{task_id}`:** returns task details with id. A success returns the requested information. Otherwise will give a failure.
*   **`PUT /tasks/{task_id}`**:  Updates the fields specified to task {task_id}. Accepts parameters to replace any values. Requires valid task ids .

All the response headers should indicate JSON type of content.  You may contact us with questions or to suggest features. The API is currently stable but will undergo changes to enhance functionality, efficiency and stability over time .  You are able to test our system at any point via Postman or other HTTP libraries . 

## Testing

Testing is a key aspect of our development cycle to maintain stability, quality and code integrity .   The repository contains an organized ` tests ` folder for the execution of various test frameworks, ensuring code functionality is verified across different configurations .  To launch a series of test, please make sure pytest and its necessary dependencies are setup correctly

*   ` pytest`: For launching Python testing framework . The project is setup to execute tests automatically as new pull- requests come into being
*   Docker and Mock Services, to test integration between components of micro- architecture..  This is achieved through mocking various system and environment services.

Execute the automated suite:
```bash
pytest -v test
```
To run the suite on different interface: ` pytest` or use a custom testing configuration

It includes unit, integration, and performance testing with automated tools that run before every release or update . All code needs test coverage of greater than 90%. You should create your tests when developing features

## Troubleshooting

A few frequently faced issue may present while working with complete deployment .

If API endpoint doesn`t respond you can try verifying if you configured database connections or environment values, such as port or database url values properly.. The API should give feedback in the log to assist.
A slow performance issue is common, try looking into the system resource allocations (CPU or disk space, memory etc) to determine any resource constraint bottlenecks and ensure your Tempo environment meets requirements,

For a Docker environment, make sure to run all the Docker processes, and the logs are configured and being sent correctly to allow proper system troubleshooting . If there were problems in a specific area such as data persistence make sure database connection parameters, usernames, access and keys match and do not overlap between services or other configurations . Contact developers or review online documentation, forums and other community support .

## Performance and Optimization

Tempo aims for peak efficiency, leveraging asynchronous tasks via message queues to prevent any slowdown .

Caching mechanisms for the commonly utilized information and responses is a key feature in improving speed while avoiding resource constraints from data processing overhead . The code utilizes database index optimizations to allow queries, reducing database processing costs by allowing for quicker searches across a data base and minimizing query response. . Horizontal scaling through multiple API Gateways or task worker pools helps Tempo adapt quickly as demands increases

Benchmarking is conducted periodically and with a range of simulated use patterns, which allows Tempo performance metrics and areas for potential improvement, with optimizations applied as results are discovered . The goal to ensure that it will meet and scale alongside business expectations

## Security Considerations

Security considerations for tempo should focus on secure coding patterns and protection from malicious actors .   Input validations is implemented on API gateways

Regular Security patches must be applied and updated promptly to keep abreast with current exploits.. Data access is limited with proper permissions

Environment-sensitive parameters (e.g API authentication keys ) need protection from access or visibility through using secrets management systems .   Security audit is performed and regularly conducted to verify the security and protection against common vulnerability issues, to identify possible exploits. The project will provide documentation about how security vulnerabilities should be disclosed safely, to prevent any malicious attacks on the environment .  We encourage anyone reporting security to use our designated reporting methods to protect users . 

## Roadmap

*   **Enhanced Task Dependency Tracking**: Add more features to manage tasks dependencies to maximize flexibility of Tempo workflows.. (Targeted release in Q3 2024).
*   **Integration with other tools:** Integrate to popular tools such as Google Workspace and Jira and Microsoft Outlook (planned by End of Year)
*   **Mobile App Support:** A companion application on mobile to access task management on iOS or Android devices will allow on-the-go updates to be made( planned to start by mid next year.)
*    **Automated Task Generation:**  Integrate an artificial learning engine for task automation based on current data to improve Tempo productivity.
