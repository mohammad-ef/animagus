## Installation Instructions

To set up Stellar Insights Data Processor, please follow the outlined steps:

First, ensure that Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your system.  This is the officially supported runtime for all of Stellar Insights features. Check the Python version with `python3 --version` on your terminal and make any updates if the installed version does not align. You will need an internet connection available in order to fetch dependencies through pip.

Before anything else you must ensure a valid and configured conda environment exists. Conda offers isolation that can resolve many dependencies issues that would impact performance of other tools within your workspace. Install Anaconda from their respective download link or via the command `conda install --yes anaconda`. Verify the conda install is running through command `conda --version`.

After confirming Anaconda, proceed by generating your conda environment through running command `conda create --name stellar_insights python=3.9`. Activate your conda environment by calling command `conda activate stellar_insights`. A conda virtual environment keeps packages isolated so other system level libraries are not altered, reducing system errors or version issues that might be present otherwise.

Now navigate to your intended installation directory with a terminal, `cd <intended location>` before cloning Stellar Insights via this `git clone [https://github.com/your_repo/stellar_insights.git]` and changing to that repository location: `cd stellar_insights`. Verify your cloned Stellar Insights directory using your terminal `ls -la`. If cloning via HTTPS failed check that you possess proper read privileges for access within github/git itself.

With repository location in the shell execute the commands,  `pip install -r requirements.txt`, this step installs core package requirements for operation as described by this text file within our repositories root. This is necessary as this project contains specific package versions and libraries. If an install is incomplete ensure internet access remains enabled, or re-verify your pip installation itself.

To resolve package dependency problems on Windows users can use `choco install -y pip` or similar package managers. For MacOS consider `brew install python3`. General issues can frequently be rectified after installing an additional library via terminal `pip install <problem_library>`, however please check the issue on forums to ensure it will solve issues. 

On some systems with legacy configurations a pip update command might also alleviate installation conflicts by executing command `pip install --upgrade pip`.  After the pip install is done, verify with `pip list` that Stellar Insights dependencies show up with a successfull install of required components for Stellar Insights functionality.
Lastly test the Stellar Insights by trying to execute example script from directory: `./scripts`, for testing basic installation setup & verifying package imports, this can reveal early errors to correct as needed.

## Usage Instructions

Once installed, the main command is executed using python.  Run the following `python main.py -i input_file.csv -o output_file.fits --threshold 0.5` in a suitable python environment. Ensure input_file.csv and output_file.fits files have write and read perissions if errors related to those filepaths surface, otherwise the system will fail the command with access denied exceptions. 

This script processes the csv `input_file.csv` transforming it and outputs a file to FITS format `output_file.fits` and it uses a custom data filtering process. You can customize the filtering threshold parameter by changing threshold values to meet research needs as needed by Stellar Insights pipeline configurations. The main file contains all of the functions to parse files and apply transformation and filters based on user specified configurations or defaults, described more deeply under Configuration settings. 

For example if you instead of filtering would rather perform an entirely other calculation like performing regression or PCA analysis replace all filtering code sections from this python main program with alternatives and execute accordingly from this main.

Advanced functionality relies heavily on customization, by importing individual processing scripts from directory ./processes to perform customized actions such as creating unique datasets. To execute, import a function from one module, for example `from modules.normalization import standardize` before running with `standardize(my_input_data, my_parameters)` and create a custom module for unique needs if necessary, ensuring to add a docstring explaining parameter details of each call as part of a well organized design system.

To explore available API calls use help system: python main.py --help and this outputs an overview and documentation to the user, showing each possible configuration option and available options for execution and parameters available, for example `-f`. This also outputs available data filetypes to parse for input as required as described above with CSV & FITS as a supported standard, though many more data format files might become possible to incorporate based on custom scripts as designed to parse them with the existing core framework of functionality. 

To perform more in-depth testing and development work use testing modules, and leverage debugging functionality. By running python test.py in a terminal it automatically will execute the tests and generate output of success, failed and any warnings, this can also expose hidden dependencies, and allow the developers for a rapid cycle. You are highly encouraged to create a new unit or integration testing module with test coverage, if introducing code that has impact on the main functions to ensure functionality fidelity.

Furthermore it is possible to create your customized CLI tools given your use cases via Python's argument parsers such as Argparse library by building the custom command lines.

## Configuration

The behavior of Stellar Insights Data Processor is largely dictated by a config.yaml file found within project repository. Within the top-level section are settings pertaining global configuration. Under data ingestion is an explicit list with allowed data extensions such as `.csv`, `.fits`, and a default schema. You are able to extend the accepted types or modify this section if your specific project uses custom schema types, for custom types please consult developer and refer to the source code in schema module directory.

Under transformations the file provides an option with which operation modules can automatically applied for dataset preprocessing for automated pipelines for data analysis and insight exploration by defining specific operations and the parameters. You may also provide a sequence that allows for multiple sequential transformations with defined dependency chains that automatically runs when executing pipelines and custom operations with user supplied parameters, such configurations enable the user greater levels of autonomy with custom workflows and rapid prototyping cycles and experimentation for iterative design.

The thresholds settings are important when applying data cleansing and filtration. It determines whether a certain metric such as noise levels in observation exceed pre-specified parameters that define an error in data collection to filter and reject or include data, the user is expected to adjust this to align to expected performance parameters. This setting is highly specific based on data collection instruments. For each filter operation such thresholds need to carefully adjusted as this parameter is used extensively by many performance critical components.

To use external modules with your scripts or to extend functionalities you should update PYTHONPATH environment variable such it can include paths towards directories where modules are kept to facilitate easier loading & accessing during the import statement in Python programs and avoid path related import error exceptions as they may happen frequently when developing new functions or components.
Configuration parameters can also be defined by calling the system variables from terminal or shell environment before calling Python main script and those settings will automatically override values within this configuration yaml, enabling flexible parameter configuration on the system, and also making scripts reusable for different deployment environments, which helps streamline deployment cycles.

Environment variables can provide more flexible configurations for cloud deployment environments for secrets management and configurations to dynamically configure the behavior on a per application deployment cycle for various operational settings as necessary and required, which helps enable a greater operational agility to adjust the settings without directly updating source codes as a part of a best development cycle and deployment pipeline. 

If there exists configuration errors in this config.yaml such it does not comply with schema or the parameters are of the wrong datatypes a YAML parsing and data conversion library is automatically activated that generates exception and provides helpful error feedback messages upon runtime for faster identification and resolution as necessary in development environments for iterative feedback.  Lastly the config YAML supports multiple configuration sections allowing multiple datasets/pipelines and can run concurrently if designed appropriately for high scale analysis, by explicitly defining properties to enable parallelism of operations for rapid throughput as necessary with a properly allocated cluster for processing tasks efficiently for massive amounts of observation information to extract scientific discoveries faster, which improves scientific productivity overall, with optimized execution settings that allow the software perform optimally with high scale throughput, as designed to accelerate science discovery efforts with the latest advancements in computing capabilities, while keeping resource consumption at its bare minimal.
