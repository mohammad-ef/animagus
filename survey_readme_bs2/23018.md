# Project: SecureNote - A Modern Notes App with Local and Cloud Sync

## 1. Description

SecureNote is designed as a versatile notes application focusing on both local persistence and seamless cloud synchronization. Built with privacy and usability in mind, it aims to offer a streamlined environment where users store ideas, reminders, or any written thoughts with strong confidence. It allows for creating, formatting, organizing, and retrieving these notes effortlessly via a simple interface, with the crucial option for automatic backups to a user designated cloud drive, like Gdrive.

It utilizes a combination of local storage (SQLite) for core note data and a lightweight REST API (built with FastAPI) to handle secure communication with cloud storage services (specifically supporting Google Drive initially, with future expansion to other drives envisioned). The application is modular allowing for extensions that can add more cloud services or advanced features like collaborative notes.

The architecture is centered on decoupling the UI from the data and API layer. The UI, which is built with a modern frontend framework (React), interacts with the API layer via standard HTTP requests to maintain modularity. Data integrity and user safety is a core design principle.  Encryption- at- rest using user generated passwords will safeguard sensitive notes. 

Security is integral. SecureNote implements robust encryption to safeguard sensitive information. All data stored locally on- device and in cloud backups is encrypted using industry standard encryption algorithms and is protected with a users generated password which they can reset at any point. 

Ultimately, Secure Note's aim is to become the go - to application for people who value privacy, organization, and the accessibility of their notes across platforms. The focus on simplicity and security distinguishes it from more bloated note - taking applications. 

## 2. Installation Instructions

First off, make sure you meet the prerequisites. You' ll generally need Python 3.9+ installed on any supported OS. It requires a relatively recent version of the Python interpreter. If you are using Linux or MacOS you're likely to have a compatible Python interpreter available by default.

Next, we need to clone the repository.  Use the following command to clone the repository from its Git repository location onto your machine. Open your terminal and run the command:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecureNote.git
```

Then change to the project's root directory after the clone is complete. You can do this by running `cd SecureNote`. It is from here that you will start the installation process.

After you change your directory into the root project directory create a `.env` file. This file will contain environment specific variables, notably the `SECRET KEY` needed to securely interact with various parts of the application. A template can be found by executing:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Within the `.env` file edit the value of `SECRET_KEY` to something that isn not a trivial password to prevent easy attacks against your API key. The default provided by `.env.example` can and should be overridden for your security!

Before continuing ensure that `pip` (or the appropriate Python package installer on your system) is available. It usually is with newer python versions; if missing please use instructions appropriate to your environment for pip installations. Once verified proceed. 

The dependencies needed for a functioning installation of SecureNote include both the front-end, built in `react` as well as Python packages which support backend functionalities. Installing dependencies should proceed by calling `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the SecureNote/backend folder.
This should automatically grab packages and create their respective install configurations to your local machine, ready for operation!

On Linux environments it could be that some libraries aren't pre-built; this requires some manual configuration or a specific build for your machine that is outside the immediate requirements here. Please look at `backend/requirements.txt` and consult relevant installation guides should errors occur related to package specific libraries and installation processes.

Finally for MacOS and windows, the installation process usually is relatively trivial with Python. If however any package dependencies cause issues with package installations try to search your respective package installers or online resources as it is not guaranteed these are issues specific to our application!



## 3. Usage Instructions

The core use of the application consists of launching both its front end, written in React via standard via `npm`, as well as running the Python server. First start Python by using `python main.py` from the root project's directory, inside the `/backend`. This initiates a local development environment on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

Once the FastAPI server starts, a new tab in your terminal or console should start. From here we will use the following code, which launches our UI, built by a React application via: `npm start`. It can launch it on any standard browser or through IDE integration for a faster developer's experience.

Upon launching this the user interface should appear within the standard UI of whatever your system uses by default!

To use the basic functions one simply clicks into each field on screen. It allows creating text and formatting notes in an accessible environment to be able to store information in their desired manner! It then allows users to create a local database as well as backup the contents to a cloud.

Cloud Backup operations need a configured `.env` as specified. It then allows for users to create, delete, retrieve and format information within the app to suit a broad audience of expectations, including storing emails and important files, as long as they are properly encoded. We also include support for advanced features to encrypt specific content.

Any data changes, and cloud changes need authentication by entering your key.  Creating, reading, retrieving are the basic CRUD features we have included, as the application is meant to be modular!



## 4. Configuration

The central point for SecureNote project's configurations is found within its root `/`. This folder houses several essential components, most critically the file `.env`.  

This `.env` is paramount to application operation because this dictates which Google account is targeted to sync, a security Key used by the backend service and several API settings! Careful configuration, including ensuring valid keys are in their respective place, can drastically effect how secure, accessible and operational the service runs on different setups!

Environment variables can influence numerous aspects like cloud drive connection settings. To modify them one can either update a local instance on your environment, by changing a file, or setting environment variables through OS mechanisms like using a CLI call or GUI application to manage. For more complex configurations involving multiple environment variables and dependencies consider the utility of configuration file libraries such as PyYAML and similar packages in your Python environment to make managing configuration a less daunting effort.

Furthermore configuration can influence logging behavior by enabling debug messages, setting custom log files or adjusting error reporting parameters within `backend/config.py`. Modifying it would involve altering the file with care for its effects, to not introduce instability to other services that depend on logging information or data flows to other locations for further inspection and analysis as it occurs!

Custom settings and behaviors, particularly those relating to encryption strength, API endpoints or user interface theme customization may require editing the codebase, specifically the `/client` frontend, which uses javascript code that needs recompilation! It includes a wide range of possible configuration parameters and customizations to be done by users and system engineers, and may also require further investigation on supporting different configurations.

Configuration file format often involves key-value mapping or JSON structures for complex settings which can allow much cleaner configuration than plain key assignments, allowing more flexible setup procedures and more modular designs with foreseeable extension support to handle various configuration parameters without needing code adjustments or modifications.




## 5. Project Structure

The core of the project is separated in to the `/backend` which is written with FastAPI to provide all core APIs. The client application lives in the `/client` directory, a standalone Javascript application to manage and interact with the application's backend! It is based in React to allow dynamic interfaces.

Here follows the directory overview for both sides, as it may provide insight in terms of organization. `/`: Project root containing `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example` files, as well as setup instructions.  

`/backend`: This houses FastAPI code, configurations (`config.py`), data schemas, API endpoints definitions. This contains a `/api` module that houses API routes which connect data from database... etc and other modules for business and domain logic, including encryption logic as specified and data validations. The database resides here using SQLALchemy ORM which simplifies database management!

`/client`: Contains a React-based UI written primarily with Javascript components. These are a front-end abstraction from the underlying backend. There are various files for CSS style and UI components and configuration for building this Javascript code!
It also houses configuration and utilities for managing UI-side dependencies!

`/tests`: All our Unit and integrated testing is stored within these files!
Each file within the directories represents tests and modules that cover each functionality within SecureNote and ensure all aspects perform to their desired functionality!

Other supporting documentation files may sit outside this hierarchy such as documentation generation scripts. This is not intended for a production build, and may contain intermediate builds or configuration settings specific to our IDE's environment as part of project setup processes which would change with each administrators' configuration and preferences!

## 9. System Architecture

SecureNote utilizes a tiered, three-layered system architecture with distinct components communicating with clearly separated layers of concern as that ensures flexibility. The three tiers, comprising of: frontend layer; data management / storage tier (including database) and API / logic handling, all interact via well - defined, documented interfaces which are crucial when developing and managing our project and ensuring stability in any updates, modifications, integrations!

The *Frontend Layer*, consisting primarily with code in React.js allows for rendering of dynamic interfaces to users to do basic input of data and manage it, which are then passed onto subsequent layers, with appropriate validations! This frontend connects and uses standard web HTTP calls for data transmission.

The *Data Management and Storage Tier* is comprised of database interactions and cloud backups which uses an underlying database engine for storing data securely, which allows data retrieval, modifications to the security layer in terms of database security policies etc! Data entry, storage & retrieval occurs through standardized APIs to maintain isolation between components - allowing us to change technologies or databases in a negligible effect in overall design! 

Finally our *API Layer (written by FastAPI)* handles data logic for data operations as it acts as middle -ware. Authentication of clients before access of data or services are validated through security measures implemented and it is designed modular so any components and changes made don,t impact various systems within SecureNote as we build on this architecture. It then provides endpoints with REST calls so we interact across our layers seamlessly to ensure that it does the best that is intended to.

These architectural components and layered approach provide modular, secure and scalable development framework. The layered nature and clearly defined communication pathways also ensure resilience as changes made don t have significant knock-on affects to surrounding functionalities or dependencies.




## 10. API Reference

SecureNote primarily exposes data management functions via standard Rest Endpoints through it.

* `/notes` endpoint is the main interface, allowing `GET` (retrieval) all stored entries with `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` actions that can allow manipulation! All responses follow JSON schema. Authentication via API-key and secret are necessary for these interactions, for data safety & management
*  `/google/login` for initialising login for connecting Google cloud account! It returns temporary keys to allow Google Cloud account to be set to the cloud drive with a Google drive connection established as the backend will use these to automatically sync with.
*  `/encryption` for encrypting, deccrypting specific notes and information. Necessary permissions need access, which would also have a specific set- of authentication requirements as it is intended as sensitive information only accessed on trusted environments

Request headers require standard API key to identify and access resources for the specific API requests! Responses provide detailed schema of the JSON output and its associated parameters. Further specifications on these parameters can be reviewed at dedicated code locations in /backend! This API design follows the core principle behind modular code - which ensures that it has well designed APIs, allowing for easier extensions of features and components!




## 11. Testing

We have integrated unit tests for backend logic using Python `pytest`.  For the React front-end application, a similar tool can allow integration and to manage testing across our codebase within different platforms for ease and flexibility as this ensures our application has quality code as it is delivered out the box and can withstand a multitude of tests under any conditions or scenarios to be sure to provide high standards in its quality for a great overall development cycle experience with high code integrity!

To start a testing framework simply launch:

``` bash
pytest tests
```

This automatically will trigger tests within /tests and will display results of all executed test runs to the command prompt for debugging purposes if errors do come into light or are discovered in testing runs to determine which components of a system need improvement to better ensure code functionality in a stable way!

Mock Environments can easily set with using the testing packages within each module for the backend which provides greater ability of modular test design. For the react- based application we provide mock services which emulate various calls which provide isolation of different testable aspects without being affected!
It's encouraged the test to cover the majority, if not most cases within your codebase - ensuring high quality assurance.

The project uses CI/CD pipeline integration that will ensure all contributions automatically trigger install runs and tests for validation of changes - before integrating to a central code base which further enforces standards.



## 12. Troubleshooting

A very common error involves incorrect Google account connections! Please review that you've authorized Google account connections correctly as that will be the core problem that leads this into the application breaking.  This can easily fix this via reviewing Google login authorization flow - ensuring the permissions requested for cloud services have full access granted to our application's cloud account.

Secondly an important issue notices often comes in regarding API errors due to misconfigured secret Key, this will often trigger authentication failures!  Carefully review all .env parameters that are used for API and secret key authentication!

Furthermore issues arise regarding file encoding - if this arises verify correct data formats when storing or transmitting file paths as they could trigger data corruptions, and proper data handling in both cloud drive and data stores are necessary, to avoid this and maintain data integrity! It will require thorough debugging and logging information for these errors, to pinpoint the exact data and files that lead this error and inform users accordingly on best methods for troubleshooting the specific situation as a solution to prevent data inconsistencies!




## 13. Performance and Optimization

The current SecureNote application prioritizes security features with a reasonable performance footprint but can certainly benefit in a variety of scenarios, and is an on- going area.  Cloud synchronisation optimization is the next big thing in improvement as there may have latency delays during file transfer and sync operations - we plan on utilizing multi- threading, caching to further accelerate performance of data transfer, particularly during sync actions.

Caching mechanisms will play crucial role here and it can involve utilizing memory- caches on server or local client - based mechanisms as appropriate depending which layer involves these requests - improving efficiency of access data, as well decreasing database calls for common data!  The data structures will play critical parts to the system's speed by using data optimized indexes on backend to dramatically decrease time taken when fetching database. This includes data compression on both frontend and server as a means for faster transfers, and lower latency for data transfer between the systems and devices involved in a data operation - improving overall application throughput and speed for an enhanced user performance experience for data transfers, data management!




## 14. Security Considerations

User authentication via strong secret generation keys must follow all recommended standards in terms of randomness generation. Encryption keys must be robust enough and should not have predictable patterns as it would open doors to attacks if the encryption process isn,t fully randomized in all its parts of implementation across our systems for both frontend- & backend -side code implementations for enhanced safety in data!

Inputs and outputs validation are vital, and the app's backend will implement comprehensive checks as input validation for any user submitted input before any action happens as an integral security protocol for protection of any injection or other risks - which can compr
