# SecureNote: Open Data Encryption with Web Client

## **1. Description**
Secure Note (or "SecureS note for shorter references") offers decentralized end to encryption for notes on user' client-machines that can easily access via a secure client application and cloud sync capabilities for backups or shared-access. Secure Note's key benefit lies is in giving you, your-user full authority for you' data security. It is built as cross-Platform. This version provides client and core encryption logic with cloud sync and API features in a roadmap. 

It leverages cryptographic principles of symmetric AES encryption with user-provided master pass-key to ensure confidentiality in data. It's built to be a robust platform for individuals to securely jot down personal ideas and thoughts with a high confidence they remain private until they wish for it be otherwise..

The Secure Snote is structured modular fashion, separating the encryption engine for portability with client and web applications that interface for data management purposes. The design promoting reutilisation in diverse systems with ease.. This approach allows us flexibility for future features while guaranteeing security.

SecureNote features intuitive UI on clients, secure cloud integration, with version support. It's not only easy but is powerful, giving users control of personal and valuable information. The goal of it to provide security that users trust. 

This initial implementation provides fundamental functionality, laying foundations for more advanced functions in upcoming release like data version tracking with collaboration feature that we expect will enhance its usefulness to a broad array of clients.

##  **2.Installation Instructions**

Secure Note's setup varies with operating. System and deployment method.. We will outline common setups below.. It is crucial users follow each steps with meticulous care so as ensure integrity security throughout process.

** Prerequisites:** You require Node v.v >= v16 to be installed for build, as the project utilizes JavaScript and a recent Node version for module dependency resolution. Python is necessary only during development to test the backend. 

** Cloning:**  First retrieve from Git by typing the appropriate commands in command- line shell, which should resolve repository into local folder.

``` bash
git clone <repository URL here>
 cd <repository>
``` 

**Installing Dependencies:**  Subsequently you install required node package dependencies by running.

 ```bash
 npm intstall
  ```
This command fetches modules listed as `dependecies or develDependencies inside  the` `packages json ` and stores to project' node directory.

** Building Project:** To compile and generate client build use. This process compiles JavaScript files and transforms into production assets like static files or server modules..

  ```bash
 npm start //For developing mode. Or use npm build to deploy for production environment
 ```

** Linux Installation Notes:** Users may experience difficulties resolving dependencies if using older versions distributions or package manager versions.. It's advisable to update systems using package manager commands specific their distro like  `apt`, `apt-get or yum`, before installation begins

  `yum update ` is an example.
**mac OS Installatioin Notes:** On macOS using Homebrew is advised for managing dependencies.. Users should ensure the environment PATH variable set correctly for proper operation. 

  `brew doctor` should assist diagnose issues and provide guidance fixing potential path problems.

**Windows Installation Notes:** Windows users might encounter issues when using Git and Node in a way that they' re expecting.. Users may want to check PATH configurations carefully or consider WSL for easier setup.

## **3.  Usage Instructions**

After successful installation running the application will vary depending chosen deployment.. Here is breakdown of common usage scenario across clients and backends to demonstrate usage:

  **Running CLI Tool (For Developers): ** You can use the command- line utility provided by to create test data.. This is helpful for testing and debugging purposes as you develop application. To use command line type `secureNote test data ` from root the project.

  **Running the Web Client:** If deployed the backend server is running, access the application from within the web by typing the following in to the your browswer ` http// localhost:3000.`

 ** Creating and Editing a Note** On initial access will require you create passkey. Then will see interface for create note.. Input note into field, save.. The client should encrypt internally with the given passkey.  You can then open, edit, or delete.

**Cloud Backup Sync**  Cloud sync will occur automatically if it configured. Ensure your backend has been properly configure to access a cloud provider (e..g S3), so that backups occur smoothly with ease..  The system periodically backs to remote storage, preventing loss of notes in case local machine suffers hardware failures..

  **Searching Notes:** Clients will be capable to searching stored notes through simple text based. This enables quick retrieval when many files.  You can then open, edit, delete.
 **Advanced Note Management:** The UI will allow you to create collections or labels and tags to group or classify notes..

## ** 4. Configuration**

Secure Not utilizes multiple levels of configuration including environment settings file, with API key configurations to allow customization.. It provides flexibility and adapts with diverse requirements of clients, from testing and production environments . 

** `config/dev.js` vs `config /prod. js`:** Development environment is configured using file called `config. js`, providing values that should differ in each deployment scenario for instance database connections . This allows flexibility for each environments.
 
  **Encryption Key Management:** The master is generated user when first use of client-side application. Do *not ever* commit to repository or share..

**Environment variable usage.**  Environment variables play role configuring backend service. `PORT` specifies what server application listen on..

 ```bash
 PORT=3001
``` 

**Customization Options:** The `app .js` files allows modification various application features such caching timeouts or maximum file size limit.  These adjustments help optimize for unique needs..

**Cloud Storage Configuration:** Secure requires configured cloud backend to work properly.. This can achieved by editing  `config.j `. Provide necessary credentials, bucket name, and region settings for selected service..

**API Endpoint URL:** The `API _ENDPOINT` configuration variable allows you specify external server for API calls if deployed across separate server environments.. This is necessary ensuring proper communication between backend and frontend systems.

**Debug Logging:** Enable more verbose logging during by setting DEBUG `true` in `config`. This valuable information help identify and resolve potential problems during application..

##  **9.System Architecture**
Secure Not's architecture revolves client server model.. A client (web app desktop app) communicates a server (Node.js Express. app) via secure HTTP requests.

The client app responsible user interfaces data presentation encryption/decryption user provided data.. Data encrypted stored securely device. 

The server is manages API requests data validation authentication cloud synchronization tasks. It communicates database (e.g. MongoDB) persistent notes data storage. 

All communication channels secure using HTTP or HTTPS protocols. Encryption performed both client and sever layers ensuring end-end- data protection. Data is encrypted using AES-25 with user supplied keys.

##  **10.. API Reference:**

 SecureNote API is used primarily by client interact with a server.. Here brief API reference: 

**`POST /api/v1 /notes`:** Creates new secured note data, requires API. Authentication headers provided by client. 

  `Response: `{ success: True / False, message: "Successful note creation."}`

 **`GET /api /v1 /notes` :** List existing notes stored user' account. Returns array encrypted notes. Authentication headers are also required for accessing.  Returns `{ note_data []}` array.  
 **`PUT /api /v1 /notes/:noteId` :** Update particular notes using specified ID with new encrypted contents. Requires Authentication, as it only applies the user associated notes..  `{success: true/false}`
**`DELETE /api/v1/notes/:noteId` :** Deletes specified note user account.. 
## ** 11 Testing**
