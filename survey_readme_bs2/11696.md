# SecureData Vault: A Privacy-Respecting Data Repository

Secure data storage while upholding user autonomy remains a critical modern requirement for numerous applications - financial services need stringent privacy controls over financial records, health providers require robust security surrounding protected data (patient records).  Secure Vault addresses a core requirement: building applications which store, process, secure data for its user base without violating privacy concerns or introducing latent attack points. Secure Data Vault (a. ka SD-V).

Secure Vault is intended and developed as privacy-preserving repository designed and constructed as both modular and extensible to support a vast number use- cases. The underlying system leverages a novel encryption strategy using symmetric encryption with ephemeral secret keys for maximum security with a modular data access framework to enable a flexible security profile tailored toward any given use case or application requirements. Its core architecture focuses minimizing attack vectors.

The modular design is crucial because security requirements shift rapidly; we aim for SD to adapt accordingly without complete redesign.  Our current implementation features secure document storage with metadata encryption to safeguard sensitive document titles alongside data encryption for content security as our primary feature.  Planned expansion incorporates role based permission control, key management infrastructure integration (using HSMs), secure data analytics and advanced auditing.

The current build is in the prototype phase, with the focus of building and verifying core encryption features as the first stage. This initial build provides core storage of both text as image-based documents with metadata encryption to safeguard sensitive document titles alongside data encryption for content security as our primary feature. SD Vault uses modern cryptography principles and standards as core tenets.

The architecture comprises three distinct modules: a cryptographic module that handles the secure generation and encryption operations using standardized encryption algorithms, data access API providing controlled interfaces which handle read and update requests; lastly and finally, metadata storage module that secures data metadata alongside its data encryption for content security as our primary feature. We use a layered architecture design pattern.

## Installation Instructions

First prerequisites for installation includes a compatible Python environment (3.9 or later), a modern terminal and a code editor for development and review of files and configurations within a project. If not installed please download these before proceeding further. This project uses python 3.9 or higher.

The primary prerequisite includes a compatible Python environment (3.8 to current). This is because many of libraries used were version specific in the implementation stages and versioning of packages. If your version differs it will cause issues. Ensure to set this as the default environment if possible.

Clone the code into a directory, preferably one which is well named and structured so it is identifiable. A well structured directory can greatly assist future maintenance efforts. We would recommend creating an `sd- vault` directory and cloning the files within such space.  

`git clonerepository_address  sd-vault`
Note repository address refers to URL where your source files are currently stored within a service. 

Before running any commands ensure you' re in root project `sd- vault` directory via the use of terminal commands such a  `.cd /your/ sdvault`.  

Then we install project specific dependencies via the usage of `pip installer requirements file`.

`python -m pip intall requirements.txt`
This should load a series of libraries which are core components for the project to function, it may return errors based off your existing environment which should be addressed as needed

For platform compatibility the project currently supports most Linux based platforms as standard for the implementation stage. For other OS such MacOS may require installing specific package libraries.  

Windows compatibility requires additional package installations such as WSL. This can greatly reduce issues encountered in installation and compatibility. 



## Usage Instructions 

To begin using the Secure Data Vault start via initializing database and creating associated user credentials. If no credentials currently exists it's important to create a new one as needed

The `sdvault` script can initialize your database.

` python sdvault_ init `

Once the database is initialized run the secure document storage with metadata encryption to safeguard sensitive document titles alongside data encryption for content security as our primary feature.  Use the `add document function` to upload new items.

  The basic document creation can be achieved through the command: `./sdvault_add` with appropriate parameters. This is a simple function.

For advanced features you'll leverage API calls. This API currently provides document uploading and querying functions as our starting featureset.  The API uses JSON for data exchange format.

The sample request looks as such
```
POST /documents/upload
{ "file_path": "path/ to file.txt","metadata":{ "title": "Secure Doc"," author": "user@domain "}
```
The API should response the location as confirmation if success, with a error code if unsuccessful

The system also enables querying of files through an `api- endpoint /documents/{id }` for a given file id and the system will display its encrypted metadata as appropriate
 
Currently, only basic usage is possible; more complex functions such access and permission features and auditing features.

## Configuration

Configuration occurs mainly via the ` config file`. The config is located under `/ configs/ ` directory within root project `sd- vault` . You can modify it via a plain text text editor as required

The `config file contains the path of the encrypted data base`,  encryption key location, and default access permissions. You can adjust them via the text edit and then save them.

You should set the data base file path and the key location so system recognizes which data is encrypted and secure to prevent data breach and corruption of encrypted file paths. 

Additionally we provide several configurable settings to modify the default security profiles.  The configuration file is formatted in YAML.

The file includes several settings such ` encryption mode`, and `key length`. You must understand their function when modifying these configurations to prevent issues.

The security profile configuration also allows the configuration of data retention and deletion policies via the configuration file. This allows for the secure handling for sensitive data as appropriate.  

Finally you' ll configure the logging settings within the configurations file. It enables debugging as needed for troubleshooting the system as a requirement.

 ## Project Structure.

The main root project `sd- vault` directory holds all components needed for system to function. The core components includes:

* `src/` holds main source files for project. The source files are the core components and functions of project.
* `configs` folder houses various config data files which govern system settings. These includes database settings, permission settings and other configurations.
* `tests/` folder holds automated test suite. It validates code and system functions.

##System Architecture  
SDV uses three-tier architecture for scalability and robustness of its functions. 

Tier one comprises data access API which serves as a gateway between external applications and backend systems, with access controls and input/output validation and sanitization to prevent injection flaws. 

Tier two comprises a cryptography module and manages data encryption using AES 256, secure storage keys as appropriate and provides cryptographic utilities. 

 Tier three handles all of metadata store and database access which manages metadata encryption using AES and provides data persistence for secure vault. The data flow follows this architecture pattern

## API Reference

The secure vault API allows access functions for secure document operations.

Currently we provide the following endpoints:

* `/ documents/upload ` for file uploading.

* `/ documents/{id}` retrieves data from given id.

The `/ upload /` API takes JSON as request parameters to ensure proper data format as required and will generate appropriate JSON responses.
