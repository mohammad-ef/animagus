# DataInsight Analyzer - Predictive Analytics Engine

## Description

Developed by the Stellar Analytics Group to provide a comprehensive, user- friendly, and highly scalable analytics service. This project leverages a distributed data processing framework to enable the efficient analysis of large data. Our goal is to democrat access to advanced predictive models by providing a simplified and customizable analytical environment. This includes data pre- processing, model training, testing, validation, and deployment all handled seamlessly. 

The architecture is designed around a plugin based modularity allowing users or other services to quickly add new analysis functions/ algorithms, or new data types. This ensures our tool remains adaptable. It can integrate with a broad range of data sources, supporting CSV, JSON, Parquet, and cloud database services like AWS S3 & Google Cloud Storage. The engine also provides visualization capabilities for exploring patterns, identifying outliers, & assessing the efficacy. 

We solve the challenge of extracting valuable insights from increasingly complex datasets, especially where time is critical. By providing a platform where data scientists * and citizen analysts -* can easily build, test, and deploy their model. The project supports both batch and (with a specialized configuration) streamed input. This flexibility caters for a diverse of business use scenarios, and provides immediate, actionable business intelligence.

This analytics engine is particularly relevant to industries that are highly data focused such as e- commerce, marketing, and finance, which can improve their forecasting abilities & operational efficacy. This engine is designed for cloud environments, leveraging autoscaling. This makes the solution both highly reliable and cost effective to operate, as you only use compute resources where you needed it.

Furthermore the tool provides a comprehensive audit and versioning trail on model training and deployment processes to ensure reproducibility, traceability to satisfy regulations, and to support model retraining when conditions change over time. It's designed to be robust & maintain simple to operate, even with minimal administrative involvement once the initial deployment is complete and configurations are in place to monitor the environment.



 ## 1. Installation Instructions 

This guide details installing DataInsight Analyzer. Before installing ensure you are comfortable with Python and basic system administration tasks. The installation process involves multiple steps from setting up your environment & downloading packages. 

We recommend creating and activating a Python venv:

```bash
  mkdir datainsight_venv # Create a new project directory
  cd datainsight_venv
 ```

Create a Python 3. 8 or newer environment: 

```shell
   python3 - m venv .venv # Create the environment directory named venv
   source .venv/bin/activate # Activates this venv
  ```

Clone the DataInsight Analyzer repository: You will need git:

    ```shell
    sudo apt update #For Linux - updates package list, not necessary on MacOS, may require admin privileges to update system packages.
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_ LINK> 	 
    ```

Install required packages via `pip`: 

```shell
pip install - r  requirements.txt # Install dependencies listed in the file
  ```

This step may vary on different platforms, ensure pip is using the venv and not an external one. For MacOS use `pip3` instead of ` pip`, as `pip` defaults may link to an outdated version.

For Windows users, ensure the Python interpreter within the virtual environment is associated with your `pip install` command. This can usually be handled by activating the venv.

The `requirements file` contains all the required python and system level tools. The system level tools required may have pre-requisite installs, ensure your base system is properly set for these dependencies, or run the system level installation guides prior to installing these requirements.

If you encounter issues while installing a package, check your pip and Python versions, and search for potential compatibility problems on the internet to ensure compatibility issues are identified, or you have the required libraries/ packages correctly set. 

If there are problems during the install, you will often see messages about package versions, ensure compatibility is considered, or consider using an older package versions in the requirements.txt if a package conflicts. 

Once you've installed the libraries, you can test the installation:
```shell
python - m  pytest # This will run the automated tests included in the codebase
  ```

This step will test the installed dependencies with a series of automated functions, this confirms a successful installation, and the code is functional.  If there are errors, please review the logs.

After successful testing, the analyzer can be configured as shown in the next chapter. This will ensure a successful and complete system install, with all tools in a working condition.   

  ## 2. Usage Instructions
   
To initiate analysis from the command line, run the `analyze` script within your DataInsight Analyzer directory, using the command ` python ./analyze.py - i <input data> - o <output file > - m <selected model> `- This command accepts several parameters to control the analysis process.

The basic usage is:
```bash   
  python ./analyze.py -i data.csv -o results.json -m linear_regression  
```
This performs a linear regression model against 'data.csv 'and saves the model in JSON format to 'results .json '.

To run a full automated test suite:
```bash   
   python -m pytest 
```
This command executes the test suite to validate the functionality of the installed packages. The test suite will run unit, functional, and integration tests across the codebase, to test various scenarios. This step is important, to ensure a successful, fully running system.

 For a more advanced configuration, such as using a streaming input, specify the `--stream `flag when running analysis:  ` python ./analyze.py -i stream.txt -o results_ stream.json -m random_forest - stream`. This tells the program to read the data one element at a time, allowing for a quicker analysis.  

If you have specific requirements, such as custom parameters for a given algorithm ( for example, setting regularization for ` linear_ regression`), these can be included in the input file and parsed accordingly, and passed into a custom training loop.  

If you have multiple models that need to be compared for a specific analysis task, run the `analyze. py ` script several times, one for each mode.

 To get more information about the arguments, or help with the analyzer, simply run the script with the command: 
```bash
 python ./analyze. py -- help
```
This will print a detailed message about the different parameters available to the analyzer.   

  ## 3. Configuration

To configure the project, edit the ' configuration. yaml ' file, that resides in the `configs ` directory. This is where you can specify default analysis parameters like dataset locations, file storage locations, and preferred algorithms.

The `configuration . yaml ` file is structured around a hierarchical configuration system:

    ```yaml
    #Default Configuration Parameters
    input_path : " data / raw / input.csv "    #Default file location. 
    output_path : " output / results . json " # Default file storage.
    selected_algorithm :  "  random_ forest "    # The algorithm to run.
    data_source : "CSV"
    data_schema : { # Define the schema if you are working with specific file formats. 
      "  feature1 " :"float",   # Defines the datatype. 
      "  feature2" :"Integer "      # Define datatypes here.  

    };  
```

You can override individual configuration parameters via command-line arguments passed during execution.  For example, to use an alternative output directory, run the ` analyzer ` script like this ` python ./analyzer .py -o alternate_output . json `- This overwrites the default specified in ` configuration . yaml `

The ` data - schema ` key lets you pre-define the datatype that you are expecting.  If this is left blank, a type inference system will determine these datatypes.  If there are problems, ensure the schema is correct.

  To modify the system's log level, you can also set it within this file as a variable `  log  = "DEBUG"` This will help debug problems with the file, as a more detailed log will be created and stored on disk, to aid in problem resolution.. 

The `configuration  . yaml  ` allows easy adjustments to the system without changing the source code. It provides a flexible, maintainable and robust system configuration to tailor this application for a diverse of needs.   

  ## 4. Project Structure

The DataInsight Analyzer repository is structured to enhance code organization and maintainability. Below is a breakdown of the main folders:

* **`src/`**: Contains the core source code, including algorithms modules, data loading & preprocessing components, and model training & evaluation logic and utility functions
*  **`tests/`**: Holds all the unit, integration, and system-level tests, to confirm the codebase meets the requirements. 
*  **`configs/`**: Stores configuration files such as  `confiquration . yaml ` that define default project settings.
* `docs/`: This directory contains all documents, including the `README`, as is.

  ## 8. System Architecture 

The DataInsight Analyzer follows a modular, layered architecture, designed for scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. It can be visualized as consisting of the following layers: 

1.  **Input Layer**: Receives the raw data through a variety of interfaces such as `CSV`, `JSON` `SQL Databases `, etc., using appropriate connectors, or streaming configurations, which is defined in the ` config `.
2.  **Pre-Processing Layer**: Transforms raw data for better analytics. Tasks such as handling `NULL ` data or data transformations happen here, also configured in the ` configuration ` section of this application.
3.  **Analytics Engine**: This module contains a core plugin framework and algorithms such as the best fitting regression model. 
4.   **Deployment & Prediction Module**: Takes input parameters (or preconfigured parameters), runs through each model and provides predictions and insights through JSON output formats or direct API endpoint integration..

Communication is done with JSON, and REST-API's between the components for maximum scalability and reliability. All layers follow the defined interfaces which provides aliasing of dependencies between tiers to facilitate future updates/upgrades.  

 The modular approach ensures each components can evolve separately without affecting core functionality, making this a scalable and adaptable tool for complex analytics problems.

  ## 9. API Reference

The core `analyzer.py` script provides a CLI interface as primary API to interact with the model engine. Here, the API endpoints and available function are described.

 * **`- i -- input-data < path >`**:  This argument dictates input datapaths from CSV/Json and other sources that the Analyzer accepts and runs its calculations upon.
  * **`- o -- output-file < path >`**: Specifies where results/model should be saved and what file path it would store its predictions at (default to < project_ directory>/out )
  * **`- m -- selected-model < mode  > `**: Chooses which pre configured analysis to select from a variety to analyze with and output structured.
 * **`-- help`**: Provides a usage and help text to explain usage options available with this CLI script
* These commands are passed as CLI parameters to trigger an analyzer function to execute on a data point

   ## 10. Testing

Thorough testing is a critical aspect of ensuring data integrity and code correctness in the project.

Testing framework `Pytest` is leveraged within a structured environment and follows best practice. To execute all of these automated function you run : 

```bash 
   python - m pytest
```
Unit Tests: Verify isolated units or individual functionalities to guarantee each code component behaves according to expected standards and guidelines
Integrative Tests: Validate integration of multiple code sections - testing how components interacts in real-life usage and confirming that these work in a functional and collaborative mode, for the most effective output of this model engine!
 End to End - System Test. Validates all functions together for a functional system output

The unit/integration & system test suite includes automated code formatting with coverage checks which can be run at commit to identify areas to refactor code that doesn;t conform and to improve maintainability

To enable test suite coverage please enable by setting the appropriate configuration and running it via pytest:  python-m pytest  - c coverage


  ## 11. Troubleshooting

Below, are commonly reported problems.
*  `Error - Module NOT Found `: This usually points at dependency issue in venv configuration . Ensure the python module that you have called from this script have their dependency in that particular module installed via venv!   

*`Input File Error- Cannot open File or Data Parsing Issues `*  
Verify file locations & datatypes that the script has defined for schema validation - ensure they correspond to the format & types defined, to avoid module errors from incorrect parsing 
     
*   `Algorithm Error  ( e.g. Out Of memory)`. - Ensure memory limits on your environment, support a reasonable memory load with enough space in a container, as some complex analytical models might have larger memory footprints
 *If there issues persist check Github Issue for further guidance and solutions.* 





  ## 12. Performance and Optimization

To achieve high efficiency & optimal performance consider using these optimization tips

Data Preprocessing should happen efficiently using optimized vectorized methods and efficient memory allocations. Leverage techniques to minimize data duplication & avoid excessive memory consumption. Parallel computation can drastically lower latency & speed processing with multi core systems by distributing computations 
Use caching, if data frequently reused and to reduce processing latency and load
Leverage the appropriate hardware acceleration for the analytical tasks to accelerate performance, and consider using dedicated machines or clusters if your workloads need this

Profiling Tools: Utilize python's integrated or external tools to identify potential code segments that may simulate slow or high-performance areas for performance analysis 

By optimizing both the data flow as the core model architecture, it can provide efficient analytical results with reduced latency.



  ## 13. Security Considerations

Security remains important when dealing with potentially confidential data or models:  Always secure access through strong access-based roles and proper data validation 
Secrets must be safely and correctly secured with encryption or a vault, so the keys can access models. Avoid committing credentials and secret information directly inside a project's repo or version- control history.

Always validate data outside to ensure input is within a range for safety. Sanitize user data with a security filter

Stay on track regarding vulnerability patches to prevent external vulnerabilities from taking your data - update packages, and monitor
If vulnerabilities or potential issues occur immediately contact us so our community is made aware for the latest updates
