# PyChess - A Python Cross-Functional Chess Game Engine and GUI with AI opponent

## Introduction & Project Goal Description: A Python Implementation

`Py Chess` (PC for short) is a sophisticated chess game implementation written fully in Python utilizing `tkinter GUI` framework as well for the frontend development. The aim is twofold: (1 to provide comprehensive functionality covering both chess logic and visual presentation (GUI interface) and (2 To include a functional AI component utilizing the minmax search for opponent gameplay in an interactive manner with different complexity levels and configurations as options, making `PC`.

The underlying structure uses an efficient data representation and algorithm optimization to support moves generation with the `UCI protocol for chess` to allow integration within external chess engines such `Stockfish`. It provides a robust foundation for further game enhancements.

The core engine manages board state validation with all standard game constraints like check, castling conditions along side game-state management with promotion rules, stalemate detection, checkate conditions and more.

The `PC GUI` component enables human to AI gameplay or human against human with an easy-to-understand layout and interactive elements with a wide number configuration options and custom themes

This tool provides both recreational chess gameplay alongside learning opportunities by showcasing how a game is constructed within code and also by providing the capability of utilizing various levels with varying complexities of `Artificial Intelligence opponents` which is beneficial for improving playing skills in strategic decision making through the game experience with AI

The goal for our implementation includes being highly extendable and adaptable to future feature updates like adding support online play functionality as also incorporating new features or modifications with user input, making the program flexible to adapt and grow within future iterations

### Installation
Before using `PC`:
* **Prereqs Installation and Environment Requirements Setup:** `Python (>=3 .9)` and a `pip installer` are essential as they provide necessary dependencies to install all required components for running this implementation correctly.  You may need additional libraries. If you are not sure of how your system handles the installation please consult the documentation.
* Make sure `virtualenv` is installable. Install with command:

```bash  # Install pip with python package manager
  curl -O http get.python org/bootstrap /pip /bootstrap .py # or python get-pip py from shell. If not found, please install using system specific tools for package management to resolve.

 python bootstrap pip bootstrap
```
  `python (>=3  9) is a requirement, please consult documentation to ensure the appropriate versions is present. If the version requirements were incorrect please consider reinstall or changing the current python installation`.
* You' ll require a working `virtual environement`. This provides a sandbox with isolated libraries for your implementation
  - Use: Create and active it using command: 

```bash
 python venv myenv
 myev/ Scripts/activate # Linux and Mac.  
 myenv/ Scripts/activate # Windows.
 ```
  - After virtual environments activation proceed further
  * `Tkinter is often bundled` with most standard distribution so there is likely nothing that requires extra setup to handle `Tkinter installation`.
* Install dependencies with `PC` by executing:
```bash  # Install necessary libraries from `pychess package
  pip install PyChess.py -r pychess_ requirements.txt

```

  - `requirements. py is required for managing dependency`. Please review and ensure dependencies are available.

  - `The `PyChess package can be easily obtained by running pip installation commands`.
* **Platform notes:** The project is platform-independendent with the exception when `Windows users should make adjustments to file paths as needed`.
* **Dependency notes:** If `PyChess doesn't function properly`, try reinstalling or upgrading packages in the virtual environement by running. 
  - `The dependencies for your implementation might conflict with current environment` Please resolve and test again

```bash # Upgrade all the packages in the current virtual environment. Please consider if upgrading might conflict with the project.  
 pip install --upgrade --force- reinstallation - r py chess_requirements txt

``` 	  

* **Installation verification steps:**  `Check by running PyChess` with the `command line instruction pychess` or `PyChess in the application launcher or IDE` that the application runs successfully after install. This indicates if installation has been done.  

* **Post-install troubleshooting:** After install, ensure you' re in `virtual enviro environment` and the `path is configured`. You may be experiencing `path errors or missing modules issues if not set up`.

  - Check your `python PATH` by running the command in `terminal: echo %PATH`

### Usages Instructions

* **Starting up the game** Launch the application using terminal by using command:

  - `pychess` (Linux or Mac):

```bash  # Run the implementation on Linux systems
  pychess
```

*  **Starting up using GUI launcher on `windows OS`:**

``` bash # Execute command on windws systems

  py chess.exe
``` 		 
* **Basic Gameplay:** Once launched you can start a new game by selecting the `Menu` -> `New Game`, and select your desired `AI level` with various options ranging from simple `AI` with minimal calculation to advanced level AI that considers several moves ahead.  You' ll see the board and move as you would during `chess gameplay`.

* **Human vs Computer Gameplay:** You play as a white and the AI will act a black or select other colors as appropriate by choosing the appropriate option on start-up of new implementation of `PyChess`
  - After you select this setup, move a pawn by `clicking the piece` then selecting `where to put your selected piece`.
  - After you select your destination `PyChess moves pieces and detects if your moves violate standard game constraints`. 
* **Online Chess Support:** Currently no `PC support`.

 * **Customizing Settings:** Go to `Menu `->` Options` for customization, adjust board themes or `AI complexity levels and configurations as options.`
  

* **Advanced AI configurations:** Modify `settings. cfg` file. `settings. cfg` contains options such as `minimax depth, heuristic weighting, or transposition tables.`  

* **AI Difficulty Adjustment:** `The difficulty level can be adjusted via the UI` or directly within `the configuration settings file, allowing customization for varying skill levels`.  `Experimenting with different level values provides a wide number options`.
 		

* **Game Saving/Loading Support:** The ability to `persist games` is currently unavailable in `PyChess implementation`.

### Configuration

* **`config. ini` File Format:**
 `PC configurations are handled by `settings. cfg` file which resides at root-level.  
* **Configuration file location:** `/ pychess/ conf/` is located. This directory houses `configuration file`. `settings. cfg` provides configuration options.

  `PC is configured via a text file`.

```  
 # Example configuration file settings: settings config file 

 [AI] 
 depth = 4
  heuristic_weight_piece =1 # Piece value
  
 [GUI] 
 theme = dark 			  	 
``` 
* **Setting AI depth:** `AI depth determines search horizon during `minimax search algorithm` for making AI decision making.` `Higher depth values increase computation cost at the trade-off of better moves`.

*  **Theme Customization:**  `Change theme to change board and piece colors`. Themes are specified by string identifiers.  `Available themes are light and dark`
  - `To modify settings restart the PC implementation after modification`. 
* **Heuristic Weightings Customization:** Fine-tune `heuristic function weightings by setting numeric values`. This affects evaluation of positions based on material and other factors.

*  **Command-Line Configuration Over rides:** Command can modify settings through environment variables, such `PC_AI_DEPTH=6 pychess` for changing `depth setting` on the `fly with a terminal command` or `scripting tool to control settings`.

  - `PC allows command-line overrides for greater flexibility in automation and testing purposes`. 
### System Architecture
* **Modular Component Design with Clear Interfaces:** `PC adopts module component structure with components for chess engine logic, GUI rendering using Tk interface, `AI algorithm with minmax implementation, and configuration management with a clear separation of roles.

* **`Chess Engine Logic with Move Genration` Core Logic of `PC` handles state management with rules validation with `move generator` to provide possible game states with a given turn sequence.

* **GUI Rendering Module with Event Loop:** The `GUI module handles visual components like `board rendering`. It also includes handling mouse events to capture piece selections with destination coordinates as inputs for moves.  
 * **`AI Algorithm Module with `MinMax Implementation with AlphaBeta Pruning`:** `AI algorithm utilizes min-max for determining AI actions during a chess- game scenario and implements optimizations by using an alpha-beta prunning algorithm. It is responsible of making strategic decisions poses`.

* **`Configuration Component Management with `config parsing ` : This allows loading setting options`. Configuration module `loads settings from setting config files to configure various components` and is critical of setting AI algorith with GUI display settings

* **Component interaction using `Events ` or Function call : Modules interact via events to communicate events to handle events` and functions for making direct method invocations with passing parameters to trigger certain functionalities` with each of those providing seamless coordination.

### API Reference
The project does not offer an public `RESTful APIs for chess-related queries with its current scope of `implementions, `

Instead of `PC API is implemented within functions that operate the `Chess- engine logic with game board and state manipulation and management, `GUI and rendering functionalities or for managing configuration settings as required

``` python  # Sample Function for Checking if Move is Legal
    def is_legal (board state piece source destination) :

   		   legalMove legal  check for `move rules on board, constraints and other considerations for validation with game` .  return true when a game follows constraints or conditions, other it does `

     #Example:
```

*The core API is embedded as methods in internal class`

### Testing

* **`Run testing for the code implementation via the terminal ` : To start up and test use: 
 ``` bash

 	 py -m unittest
``` 	or

 ``` python
 	 import unittesting; unittesting unit tests; test all cases 

```
 *  **Run Unit Testing and Verification of Code Components:** To start unit tests, you should ensure ` pytest framework with dependencies for unittesting is correctly available on implementation`.  The unit ` testing will run to verify that all code component functionalities perform correctly as specified

  	 -`Unit tests should check logical operations of functions with testing boundary cases to ensure they are working`.

* **Run Testing for integration to `Check Interactions`: Run to run the test and check integration and interactions between code component interactions for the game implementation, with a focus and emphasis on `AI with board management,`
 * `GUI components`. 

 *  To start with integration use
   
 	 py_testing _module test. integration.  	# Test with the integrated environment. Check for the integration of each piece

### Troubleshooting

* **Dependency Installation Issues**
 If you experience difficulties install, try `upgrading pip, reinstall python and virtual environment or resolve conflict by upgrading all libraries to latest compatible releases`: `pip install pip --upgrade and test after this operation to confirm resolution.` 
	  Check the error output carefully as that might indicate if dependencies is missing`.


* **`Application not launching` Error**: Make sure all requirements are install correctly `and environment `path configured and correct `. Also double-check with `permission to access` file paths as it may limit execution of programs and prevent the `program`.	  		
 	 - `Doublecheck if Python versions match requirements or are conflicting`.
	

* **Board display rendering issues`: If rendering problems happen on GUI with incorrect display `ensure all packages with `python and graphics library is correct. Try `update or upgrade packages for better performance with rendering and compatibility`, or `consider updating graphics hardware with driver to prevent issues with GUI components`.  			   
  - Ensure correct graphics `system is present, otherwise, the application is prone to display issues.`


* ** `Game not running ` issues ` Check that your programs runs correctly without throwing runtime exception` . If so check if all `dependencies exist or missing from the project `. Also double ` check that file and configuration setting files is correct, as incorrect paths, file formats can result`

### Performance and Optimization

* **Minmax algorithm optimization**:
`To optimize the performance for `chess engine with an `alpha_beta algorithm for improving search performance.` This involves techniques like trans position and memoize for `move generation`, with reducing `redundant computations by storing results for faster retrieval`,

* **Data Representation for chess `state`:** Using data structures that can store board variables with minimal overhead. 

### Security Considerations

*  `Avoid using direct command injection to reduce vulnerability and improve the security` and instead validate the inputs and prevent security threats, `Prevent injection of external code to stop risks to security of data` `Implement data sanitizing`.	

* `Avoid Hardcode of API or secrets in configuration`. Store credentials ` securely, for protecting credentials from unauthorized accesses and exposure`,

*	Regular updates, ensure to update your system `and library regularly for mitigating known threats or resolving new vulnerability discovered`.


### Roadmap

* [ ] Implementing the full implementation of a online Chess support to play with friends or others with various options
*  [ ] Implement single and two play games.
*  [ ] Add more `GUI features such animations for `chess pieces with a visual enhancement, to provide interactive and more enjoyable playing with experience

### FAQ

* `Question: I get module `missing errors`, how ` to do it?: Ensure the environment with packages are now set with correct dependencies install, verify paths correctly `
 *Question : How should one modify difficulty setting?: `You change AI setting with setting. configuration files, modify the level depth for the minimax with other setting`.
