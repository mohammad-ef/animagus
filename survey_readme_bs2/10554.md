# SecureNote Project: Distributed, Encryption-Protected Digital Notebook 

**Description**

SecureNote is a distributed application that provides encrypted note-taking capabilities designed for sensitive information storage.  The system utilizes cryptographic techniques to guarantee confidentiality while offering robust sharing permissions.  Users are granted granular access control and version history for enhanced security and auditability. This allows for collaboration while safeguarding data integrity and privacy from unauthorized parties, addressing a critical security need.

It implements peer-to-peer synchronization to minimize central authority risk by eliminating the reliance single point of failure. The application prioritizes simplicity in use while maintaining high data safety standards. Data is segmented and encrypted locally, preventing potential breaches of sensitive data at any level. SecureNote's core is a decentralized architecture designed specifically to safeguard sensitive personal or proprietary data from potential threats.

The system features secure authentication methods and role-based access controls. The design emphasizes a modular architecture that can incorporate future security updates and new features efficiently. The project is intended primarily for security professionals, privacy-conscious individuals, or any group that must protect sensitive textual information. It's built to be a lightweight, self-hosted and decentralized digital note application that can function even without internet connection after synchronization.

Security is achieved through AES-256 encryption with unique keys for each user. The peer-to-peer architecture ensures redundancy by keeping notes synced on several different clients at the same time, eliminating the danger of data loss or central compromise. The software aims to provide end users the highest standards for privacy in digital document retention, with features tailored towards secure note sharing capabilities with customizable roles and permissions.

This software has the capacity to provide security against external data access as well as prevent potential accidental disclosures of critical documents to the public, by utilizing end-to-end encryption that ensures all stored note-based text cannot be interpreted outside designated user groups with access privileges. Furthermore, the architecture's focus minimizes trust and enhances transparency as a critical addition for those needing maximum confidentiality protection within digital storage platforms. 

**Installation Instructions**

Prerequisites for installing SecureNote include a supported operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows). A development environment including Python 3.8 or later is required, as well as the `pip` package manager for installing project dependencies. A basic familiarity with the command-line is recommended. 

The software is provided in source code format which needs to be compiled from custom installation packages, requiring Git and necessary build tooling installed beforehand for a complete build setup for SecureNote. The recommended setup for the system utilizes Linux or macOS operating system. Ensure all libraries listed in `requirements.txt` have their respective versions available to guarantee a stable build setup for your installation of SecureNote.

To begin, clone the SecureNote repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/securenote.git
```
Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd securenote
```
Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It's important to note this installation utilizes python-based tools such as flask to support API requests. The python interpreter must be correctly available, including access through `PATH`. If errors related to environment configuration emerge it could mean an environment such as virtualenv wasn.t configured properly or necessary permissions for file operations.

On Linux, ensure you have build tools such as `gcc` and `make` installed, often via your package manager: `sudo apt-get install build-essential` or a comparable equivalent for distributions, as well as Python dependencies installed. For macOS, Xcode Command Line Tools may be required; installation instructions are readily accessible in online help documents from Apple and the software developer resources online.

On Windows, Python needs to be added to your PATH, or the command interpreter will throw access errors or module-not-found problems when executing scripts using command shell, such as pip or your python application launch.  It also supports running through a virtual python container using `docker`. This helps manage different python library versioning between separate builds and avoids global conflicts when working with numerous python programs and applications on different systems and development environments.

After installation complete, configure encryption settings in `config.yml` with your unique salts or secret phrases which act as initial data seeding points during note processing to limit unauthorized external decryption possibilities. It should always be stored and backed-up properly away from primary systems, since it can lead to a full-compromise should that key file come under their management by external attackers, hackers or internal data-thieves with access.

Before executing your project make sure it's configured for secure network operations. During local tests use self signed certificates. During deployments, secure with valid SSL Certificates, and always follow best-practices and guidance around secure server administration when handling user data. Secure note uses TLS for secure communications, make sure all certificates or network access rules align.

**Usage Instructions**

After installation, run the application from the command line using the start command defined within project startup configuration file, typically called: `start.py`

```bash
python start.py
```

This command initializes the local development server at http://localhost:5000 and the peer network discovers nodes upon the launch process automatically as well by using default broadcast configurations in project network parameters configuration section defined inside configuration files for peer networking protocols used internally for inter node information synchronization across different instances during peer networking setup for SecureNote's operations in network environments that support node broadcast discovery features in operating networks or system infrastructures used during runtime and development.

SecureNote features are mainly access controlled through RESTful APIs for creating notes, fetching notes, encrypting notes. You can create new notes by POSTing a request to the /notes endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "My Secret Note", "content": "This is a confidential note."}' http://localhost:5000/notes
```

You'll receive an acknowledgement and response including new id generated upon a successfully note save and confirmation from peer-to-peer nodes involved.  Note retrieval requests happen via fetching with specified ids. To fetch the notes, you must POST the notes with a request that uses a `GET` to `/note/{id}` and the appropriate `Authorization` and `User Credentials`, such as a session token and authentication parameters from an earlier logged user profile to prevent potential security breaches and malicious note retrieval.

You can modify a given Note ID from previous note creation request or a `GET` note request via using the PUT endpoint. For security considerations the note needs reencryption upon a modified PUT request to ensure confidentiality, using the key generated at first during initial creation, as that is a crucial security aspect of SecureNote and is enforced. 

To enable advanced features like secure sharing and permission levels. Utilize role assignment functions, such as the `/role` POST request endpoint and assign appropriate levels, which act to filter which parts and segments or data within an overall Note ID get displayed, edited or accessed via user profiles during runtime access to data stored inside of peer node network for decentralized secure notetaking platform and application usage by users within an organization with specific roles. 

For testing with mock user access levels you may enable debugging by adding `-d` argument, this will bypass all role based checks, which can aid rapid iteration during initial software design. 

Secure Note can integrate through external APIs. To use those functions use POST request, specifying `api_call: "External_API_Method"`, with all appropriate authentication keys as required in your request headers, ensuring all API integrations use HTTPS, not standard plain unencrypted communications during external connectivity.  Always test with a sandbox environment and follow security recommendations to mitigate external data exposure threats or attacks to data integrity of SecureNote application,

You should review your notes often with the watchdog function, that provides security warnings when potential risks are observed within network nodes to prevent encounter and resolution during system deployment, configuration and operations to safeguard critical documents.



**Configuration**

SecureNote is configured through the `config.yml` file, which dictates key settings related to its core behaviors and functionalities like API endpoint, encryption keys, security rules etcetera for data integrity within Secure Note system and operations in secure environments and secure network settings across peer networking nodes. Ensure the path points directly for system configurations during setup and deployments, to avoid errors in network access to system data and operations in network deployments.

Within `config.yml`, `encryption_key` specifies a key for the AES-256 encryption. It *must* be securely stored, preferably via a system environment or dedicated secrets vault that isn\'t directly included or checked within a publicly visible version source code repositories as part of your version-tracked development process, as a compromise would compromise data integrity of stored and synchronized data, which requires careful security oversight in your data lifecycle, which should always have a proper review of all system files during code audits to safeguard from unintentional inclusion during deployments,

The `/api_host` and `/api_port` define the server that accepts HTTP or TLS connection endpoints to manage access from the clients through APIs with authentication tokens during user authentication processes as required in API requests or client application access and data exchange for SecureNote. Ensure that proper TLS configuration, as described prior with proper certification setup. are always enabled, which should align during development testing to mirror the real operational settings for security considerations of the application.

Permissions configurations for users within role based authorization systems is described under key `/roles`. Here you may create user levels with granular privileges, like "Admin", or read access only, for security management during deployments to manage sensitive data with secure note sharing and access control, which must adhere security governance specifications during deployment phases in organizational or private data network infrastructures. 

You can enable logging to a `/logs/securenote.log` by defining the flag set for log enabled, with detailed levels and error-tracking. Logging helps diagnose system-level failures. This enables rapid error analysis when problems and failures happen in your secure data storage, by enabling tracing, auditing to prevent system compromises and failures with data integrity safeguards.   

For enhanced functionality, define the number of nodes for a decentralized environment using  `network_nodes:` and embedded IP Addresses. These settings help maintain effective and efficient distributed storage during synchronization operations in your networks and peer nodes.

To configure caching mechanisms that enhance response rates you must setup appropriate values with key definitions such as time to lives or memory allocations as required, in `network_caches:` section and configure with memory-bound settings. These cache cycles help optimize the application for faster data retrievals, improving system efficiency with low data access costs in network settings during prolonged use across multiple client machines with synchronized note management, as required and specified within network settings configurations, for SecureNote operations on live environments with multiple client nodes.

SecureNote utilizes external service calls defined in `/ext_services` section which defines the endpoints to interact, requiring specific API-Key parameters as defined under each call in configurations for authentication of secure external communications from external integrations.
