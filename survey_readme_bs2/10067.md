# PyChess - A Python Cross-Functional Chess Game Engine and GUI with AI opponent

## Introduction & Project Goal Description: A Python Implementation

`Py Chess` (PC for short) is a sophisticated chess game implementation written fully in Python utilizing `tkinter GUI` framework as well for the frontend display. The main goal and aim for Py Chess, besides providing the functionality of an interactive chessboard where humans can challenge the machine or even themselves with two-players mode (human-vs Human) has to also, to incorporate Artificial intelligence (AI), that provides a formidable AI-powered challenger that employs `minimax search`.

Furthermore, the system will incorporate a GUI, so the players do no require knowledge of coding and can easily access the chess engine from the GUI. It's built as cross functional project where it provides a backend game engine and can easily be connected via an API, and also includes a fully working frontend to be used for human interactions as a chess player or for machine interactions with a chess bot. 

PC aims at demonstrating practical application of AI algorithms, providing a flexible game framework adaptable to variations/rules of chess, providing intuitive user experience with an appealing frontend interface.

We have also implemented logging to record every single movement of chess, which provides useful debugging features when the chess engine encounters any exceptions during execution. In addition, the engine supports various file format for recording the game history. The recorded game could later used in analysis of a chess master or a machine, so the user or a bot can review it to identify strengths as well a areas that needed improvements on a player skill.

Our code adheres strongly toward the SOLID design principals with each class, function and modules having distinct roles, with low-coupling as possible. We have implemented several testing suites that cover different corner cases, which helps in assuring the quality and reliability of each module.


 ## Description
The project revolves to build a robust Python chess engine, and it offers both an interactive GUI (Graphical User Interface), which allows user interaction through a visual chessboard display as well a machine intelligence challenger that uses the well-established `minimax`. PC also features robust logging mechanism as well support for game saving and retrieval of game state, allowing for detailed review and study. It's modular design promotes code maintainabilability as a plus.

Py- Chess, a modular chess engine that, when coupled with it GUI frontend allows for interactive play or machine-to-machine analysis via external applications through the well designed and flexible interface. Its design emphasizes both user accessibility as also machine learning capabilities as we incorporate the minimax search strategy for enhanced AI opponents as an added plus in its core architecture and implementation design.. It also has a built in engine and a user configurable engine.

This engine provides a comprehensive suite of features for those involved to analyze chess games, test and enhance chess algorithms with ease. With an intuitive GUI as an interface for both casual game experience with AI and a more robust and analytical tool for the more avid or advanced user, making it ideal for learning about AI and chess simultaneously with a well designed architecture. 

PC provides a foundation to build upon, offering an adaptable and extend platform where future iterations could incorporate advanced AI models, online play and other enhancements as a means to continue improving and evolving it capabilities.

The code has also been written using Pythonic idioms and style, ensuring a readable, maintainable as a robust foundation for the software project. 

## Installation Instructions
Before installation ensure Python is version 3.7+ is present. 
First clone the repository from `git@github. com:your-username/PyChess .git ` 
Navigate to that newly made cloned directory: 	 		 	

``` bash 
cd PyChess 
```
Next to create a new virtual environment for this to be executed in, use: 
```python 
python -m venv .venv 
```
Activate the virtual environments by using:
On Linux/ macOS, the activation of virtual enviro is accomplished by running command:
```bash  
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows, the virtual envior is activated via the command:
```powers hell 
 .venv/ Scripts/ activate
```
With activation accomplished we must install our project requirements by running the following command in terminal window:

```bash 
pip install requirements.txt
```

This should install everything that the project requires, namely `numpy`, `pygame`, as an important note `pillow` also is required.
Once installation has been accomplished run the following in terminal:

```python
python main.py
```	

The main application interface, will pop on screen and now Py Chess, can start running with no error messages in its execution. 	

The system supports both Linux, macOS (macOS versions above Mojave is supported), and Windows operating systems with Python installed correctly. 	

The `requirements. file, provides the complete requirements and versions that the application requires, so that users can always replicate it environment as required for running this system correctly. 		

If there are any issues installing modules or libraries, try upgrading `pip` to latest available version. 	

Also, ensure that any firewalls and anti viruses, don't block any access or network communications during install and execution of this chess. 

If any module is not correctly found, please consult online documentaion on Python and its modules. Also please verify the versioning of the system, to assure compatiblity issues are not present. 		

## Usage Instructions
The main GUI interface will show the game board, which contains 64 squares of chess.

To play, select an appropriate square with desired piece and move to a legal position in its move path.  

When moving the piece a pop up should display the legality of it position, if its a valid move or invalid position.
If invalid, there should be a clear error message. 		

To start a new game simply click the start menu on the GUI interface. 

To challenge an engine opponent just click "Challenge Opponent on GUI" button on the menu.	 

To challenge another player on two- player mode, click on "Start Two Player Mode". 
In two- player the GUI displays an interface where each player takes turns and moves pieces accordingly.	

In engine challenger, it uses minimax strategy to determine the optimal path to move. 
The AI strength is tunable via GUI, by configuring parameters to control search depth, heuristic functions. 

Saving the game is available via "Save Game" button to a pre- configured file, that allows later restoration of state.
Loading the game is available via loading file from save directory. 

Game statistics and history, is tracked and available to user for analysis on the menu of GUI. 	
Advanced usages involves using its Python engine via its API to interact with external chess applications or bots, to create complex and custom scenarios, with external integrations. 	

The game has built-in tutorial which guides on how the system is being used, by clicking the tutorial in the GUI.

To play against yourself or an external chess engine user can change to human or an engine, as an option. 		 		
 		

## Configuration
The project configuration is mainly managed through environment variables. 	

`AI_DEPTH` sets the depth level used during the minimax searches by the chess- AI engine. Higher values provide stronger, slower opponents.

``` bash 
export AI_DEPTH=5
```
`LOGGING_LEVEL` determines the detail in logging. Values are `debug ,info,warning,error,critical`.	 
``` bash
export LOGGING_ LEVEL=info
```

Configuration values can also be changed by directly editing the `.env` files in the configuration folder as needed.	 

Game difficulty settings in AI are configured in the `ai_config file`, where users can tune search parameters, heuristic parameters as per needs. 	

User preferences, e. g. board size as color scheme, can be configured via GUI interface, by selecting appropriate options. 

To modify custom file formats, editing file formats, editing file formats, editing file formats, editing the config file `settings. json `.

## System Architecture
The System comprises a backend Engine Module (core), frontend module(displaying chess as board as a interface as GUI),  ai as an module for intelligent gameplay, with utilities to help support.
Backend is core chess Engine that implements chess rules and algorithms and game logics.
Frontend is implemented via GUI and displays chess board with interactions of mouse click as function, it handles UI updates with connection backend and storing user settings to be saved for ease to reus. 

Data Flow starts with GUI which receives user moves, send these move commands into core game engines(chess core logic ). AI modules generates the opponent actions. Engine process move validations of game states as update, GUI reflects this changes accordingly, providing user the interface on chess and gameplay, with all data flow as interaction to it as plus 
It follows model as a MVC as function as pattern ( model-view as controller). Therefore core game logics is separate as an function 
## API Reference
`pychess.engine.move (board, move)  `-  Validating move, update of internal state of a game with a chess piece and returns boolean value if the moves are acceptable as well correct
	Input
 		board 				  chess_ board object
 		move			move in a format of 				
		Returns :
			Boolean value as if it move can happen 
			Returns :		True,False as an indicator as if the state of a system can become.
 	```
pychess.ai.minimax(board, depth) :
``` Returns best next possible chessmove to make for current turn, it is determined through Minimax algorithm to determine the outcome with specified `Depth. 

```python
 		board -  object of the state chess board
		Depth 				 - search depth level for engine, determines its power and complexity
 		 Return	bestChess move
 ```	
###	 		Testing		 	

## Testing
Py Chess comes complete a comprehensive testing to assure stability as functionality of chess and system in a robust fashion. Testing is implemented in a directory test as an addition for project structure. The test uses a framework called Python`s``unit test framework`, for easy integration with the test suite

Each function of the chess modules will test via the use with several edge and cases with the chess as pieces as a means 
The system includes testing with integration testing for the interaction with different functions, so all parts and features as integrated together, as means and function
Testing can easily accomplished in terminal of system using a `command`:  `` python-m unittest  discovery-  . ``  	

	Testing the engine for corner test case is important to assure functionality 
## Troubleshooting
Common issue includes import modules as function
Ensure to activate Virtual as a function as well, to assure environment and modules can find correct dependencies
Module error can happen if modules are incorrect and versions isn compatible so upgrade with correct including all versioning as dependency for code function

If any AI module not responding it is often because there has a depth as setting that it requires more computational resource to complete a chess engine with an action as move and function as required 

	For any additional configuration please reference documentation.			

## Performance and Optimization
The system employs several features that minimizes runtime and maximize runtime
Caching of previously visited as states of board helps reduce computations when AI performs as moves to the chessboard with a board and game state

Using optimized chess engine as code algorithms for efficient as processing 
Concurrency is not implemented to reduce runtime. However in some future, concurrency as an feature may improve the speed

	Profiling code is useful when identifying and optimize any hotspots with bottleneck 	
## Security Considerations
Secrets are handled through secure variables so there are never any credentials stored.  	
Input from players will be carefully handled for security and vulnerabilities, for validation 

Ensure system and code always up- to date.
Any reports will provide and we'd like users of system can send feedback to address vulnerabilities and bugs 
	For any questions please see security guide in docs directory		

## Roadmap
The future roadmap plans as follow 

	Add two online multiplayer features so it'll work on internet and online
 	Incorporate a online player rating for a player as plus.
