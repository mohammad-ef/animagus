# CONTRIBUTING.md - Project Zenith (Example Project, adjust names/instructions to match reality. Remember the line limits and short paragraph requirements in all cases!  The content must meet those criteria precisely, with no extras). This guide assumes Git. It must follow ALL the requirements exactly, without deviation, in formatting (short paras) *including* line limits of 2-4 lines each.

## 1. Introduction
We warmly welcome all individuals who want to improve Project Zenith! Contributions large or tiny are extremely helpful. This project strives to be a collaborative ecosystem. Your input can significantly accelerate progress and improve the project for everyone to use and enjoy! Both experienced and new developers (plus non-coders!) are welcome and valued in our process.

## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##2 CodeOfConduct
To maintain an encouraging and safe workspace, a certain degree of respect among our participants is a must. Every person must engage with empathy and compassion when interacting with fellow contributors. Discrimination or disrespectful remarks are strictly prohibited and are a serious violation. Please consider this guide carefully.

Violations of any sort will trigger the project maintainers to address and, when necessary, restrict future access.  Open dialogue in good faith remains critical and valued; any form of abusive or oppressive language will result in enforcement measures taken against offending accounts. The goal remains creating inclusive, friendly and supportive spaces to build and innovate together. 

## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##3. Getting Started
To get going, fork the repository and clone your fork to your local machine. Install any required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root directory. Next, create a new branch with a descriptive name based on your desired task like `git checkout -b feature/add-logging`. Remember always to keep your forked branch updated by merging upstream changes, to reduce the chance of integration challenges down the line.

Ensure that Git is installed. Then verify all your configurations for git (your email address) is appropriate so your contributions are associated correctly with your accounts, this includes configuring tools to track contributions automatically, so that everything gets properly recorded and tracked. Lastly, confirm a local environment suitable for Project Zenith development can function, by building it using `python setup.py build`.

We advocate utilizing an isolated virtual environment for Project Zenith while actively building/testing locally. This keeps external dependencies and version incompatibilities isolated to only Zenith related files or folders.  This prevents conflicting dependencies in any system installations from potentially impacting, damaging or disrupting any of your build procedures for our core Zenith application. 

Always commit frequently, but also commit meaningful messages (refer to Commit Message Guidelines below) that provide sufficient details for other developers and collaborators on readiness status. Push often and early as your progress develops. Finally test often by verifying functionality with local test environments prior to merging any new or significant modifications to ensure stability is upheld for everyone in a team environment.

## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##4. How to Contribute
You're free to enhance our documentation or file an error if it breaks for you.  Submit well-described Feature Request tickets for ideas to help our project. You may also directly offer code changes. However, always engage our contributors on substantial changes before commencing to minimize potential disagreements on implementation strategies and design approaches down the track.

Reporting issues or creating documentation enhancements is also vital work! Don't limit contributions solely to fixing or developing new features - any feedback that can aid clarity is welcomed.  Small changes to documentation are also incredibly helpful and welcome. Please ensure a detailed explanation and reproduction process is present with issue descriptions or enhancements so they can get reviewed quickly and thoroughly. 

Remember the open discussion aspect - engage our project maintainers via issues before undertaking extensive refactorings, especially for large features and architectural overhauls. Discussing the plan proactively fosters collaboration and ensures changes are better incorporated within project's broader scope, minimizing surprises. Project maintainers are more open to suggestions, feedback and improvements when a collaborative spirit shines!

We very strongly believe encouragement in a community atmosphere and the ability to ask and receive helpful guidance is vital for any growing and developing software project to thrive; any form of negative feedback will simply not be entertained within Project Zenith, but helpful advice from other users are highly appreciated. Don`t feel shy; engage early to avoid rework later.


## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##5. Reporting Bugs
When you find a bug, search the existing issues first! If your topic exists please comment with details, otherwise start a fresh report in GitHub Issues. A well-detailed bug report helps maintainers swiftly grasp your predicament. It should outline the bug, environment it occurred in (OS, dependencies), steps taken.

Provide minimal reproduction example code, so developers reproduce your error directly and verify fixes effectively. This saves significant effort when attempting bug fixing; including reproducible scenarios significantly increases speed for resolution of issues or problems, while simultaneously lowering development cycles to a manageable timeframe.

Please ensure you clearly specify which operating system (or platforms supported by our project that the errors have occurred within). It would benefit developers immensely. Be certain of the steps, environment and expected outcomes when creating the scenario to ensure clarity and avoid ambiguity when reporting your findings with your report or tickets!

Remember, concise bug descriptions that contain steps, context, error information & minimal examples make the whole team more successful.

## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##6. Suggesting Enhancements
Propose enhancements through GitHub Issues labeled `enhancement`. Briefly outline your proposal including what new value the enhancement provides for end users.  Clearly explain what problem the improvement solves using realistic or concrete usage scenarios; the clearer it is the quicker the assessment!

Provide motivation and potential benefits of the feature to justify its consideration by the team and explain its impact within Zenith`s current or prospective ecosystem; what are potential users or stakeholders gaining or what pain-points would it solve if successfully adopted as core components.

Enhancements undergo thoughtful review based on our vision, feasibility, complexity and impact and prioritization of our current workload to decide their feasibility; some proposals can require more effort, which might lead to them getting shelved. However your contribution matters and will always provide guidance on Zenith future roadmap.

The project prioritization guidelines for evaluating potential enhancement ideas include the overall scope impact (high-vs-low) versus engineering time to develop/deliver. The decision-making matrix for feature enhancement implementation ensures efficient usage of resources while balancing project requirements alongside community requests, which are critical components within development workflows!

## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##7. Pull Request Process
To propose modifications, fork the repository, and branch with a distinct feature prefix such as `feature/xyz-cool-update`. Then, create commit message aligned to convention described (e.g. *`feat(auth): Adds login API endpoints`*)! Once pushed push changes locally using a standard `git push origin your-branch`.  Submit as a Pull Request towards `main` or `develop` for integration.

The process will include automatic and human reviews of changes and a thorough suite of integration tests for stability and functionality verification and consistency before being incorporated. Please update pull request with detailed descriptions highlighting rationale and implementation specifics to assist during evaluations by maintainers; ensure your description accurately reflects any alterations.
Code changes must pass continuous integration and code linting checks; ensure code conforms with Project Zenith's standard coding standards outlined. Maintain clear descriptions to enhance review and validation user comprehension. The final decision rests ultimately with a core group and may request iterative adjustments based affected scope and integration consequences within broader architecture or code components

## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##8. Coding Standards
Maintain coding clarity, following PEP 8 standards for Python with specific deviations as defined within .pylintrc. Utilize docstrings thoroughly and keep them descriptive! Code consistency ensures the team collaborates effectively on a common code style; this reduces errors and simplifies future development initiatives significantly, promoting code stability over variety across different modules!

Implement thorough unit testing (covered further under the *Testing Guidelines*) to confirm functionality correctness before merging and maintain adequate type hinting. Adherence improves collaboration; code is readily understood when consistent standards guide developers and simplifies integration for any contributors, while reducing potential confusion arising. Automated linting is encouraged using the specified project config to detect code issues early!

Enforce static code checks (using pylint and flake8 as specified) before any PR review is started by project developers; ensure your PR conforms using automated lint tests or code analysis checks to minimize potential errors that would delay the approval workflow process! This proactive step promotes high-quality and robustness of code, as it identifies common style and code-related pitfalls and errors prior during PR assessments or reviews and minimizes future maintenance costs significantly.

## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##9. Testing Guidelines
Project Zenith relies on testing heavily.  All submissions are checked through a testing environment. Before merging changes, please add appropriate unit, integration and even functional tests. We suggest pytest framework for the implementation, following conventions specified inside of the tests directories. All submissions will require all test suites passed and verified!

To start with existing tests run command, `pytest --cov=zenith` or `pytest --cov=project-zenith  <test directory>`;  If no such command exists consult with Project Developers and team maintainers about setup for testing frameworks within your local environments before beginning. When introducing alterations, new test should be implemented, covering the new or revised code sections!  This ensures the functionality is thoroughly verified, which safeguards the integrity, quality of Zenith and minimizes regressions down future updates/development.

Writing unit, integration, or end-to-end testing are extremely helpful when verifying the new and modified changes. Test coverage needs at least be around `80%`. The tests provide a strong foundation; therefore comprehensive, accurate coverage of the existing functionality is vital for the long-term sustainability and stability that the overall development workflow relies! Robust unit-tested code will be easier, cleaner to extend.

Always ensure to review any error/warnings when testing locally; address errors and issues prior pushing any commits that would introduce failures into CI deployment environments by verifying the functionality tested before submission. It mitigates delays to maintainers, as well prevents introduction or potential propagation failures across the codebase as a consequence to incomplete and untested implementations during submission and review periods!

## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##10. Documentation Contributions
Documentation enhancements improve accessibility; they welcome all! Please contribute using our project documentation format, commonly Markdown files stored in /docs folder for project website; any edits need consistent style, formatting with project standard conventions and clear explanations with relevant context when providing updates/modifications on content. All new and changed documents must have associated descriptions to improve discoverability for potential stakeholders/contributors and end users seeking clarity within Project Zenith's scope!

Maintain accurate and clear descriptions within markdown documents so they easily explain Zenith`s components; ensure descriptions adhere strictly within Project standards; this facilitates user adoption while also assisting maintainers and collaborators to grasp project functionality! Any contributions require review by maintainers; however the contribution is valued and helps grow the community and improves project visibility significantly and promotes better engagement within Zenith and wider development scope and ecosystem around our team/developers involved in development process, especially for new contributors

Ensure that documentation files and code examples remain current by reflecting all new releases; update relevant references; verify any deprecated functionality; remove or correct inaccuracies that impact users' perception about Zenith, while adhering to our standards. The overall purpose and intention behind these practices ensures consistent quality; it promotes transparency; enhances project visibility and builds stronger community!



## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##11. Commit Message Guidelines
Commits must be informative. Commit descriptions ought follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) scheme. Prefix your message to identify the type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`). Add brief description, following with a body describing any additional context and motivation, when required or appropriate.

Utilize clear language that is descriptive to help collaborators grasp quickly purpose. Commit summaries and bodies provide a clear audit trail when examining past contributions. The project maintainers utilize these records in release generation; so accurate summaries are vital. Use consistent phrasing, so maintain a unified standard within a team of many contributors to facilitate code readability over time, to reduce cognitive costs, which increases efficiency in development processes and workflows.

Adopting these standardized formats enhances clarity when examining the contribution timeline across the repository, prompting easier collaboration among various participants. A clean, clear message ensures all members are well equipped to swiftly interpret code changes within project history. A unified approach reduces any miscommunication while promoting streamlined workflows within teams across Zenith development.

Always follow-up a `feat` prefix using detailed information that encapsulates exactly why/when you added functionality, while `fix` commits ought include information detailing why and how a given issue gets rectified, ensuring maintainability by others within Project Zenith development! A good description ensures a better overall code experience by all members, and facilitates collaboration within Zenith team!

## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##12. Branching Model
We adopt a standard Git Flow. Typically develop branch receives ongoing changes while maintain focuses primarily onto stabilization efforts. New enhancements, feature updates, and hot fixes typically branch from development. The master branches holds the released and tagged versions! This structure promotes isolation while minimizing disruption to main program stability; which helps ensure that production environments receive reliable, thoroughly vetted code and software builds.

Avoid direct modifications onto either 'main' or 'develop'. These branches require thorough verification/stabilization safeguards before release; branching enables developers to freely work/modify, testing features and bugfixes without interfering production environments or impacting ongoing releases. This strategy reduces potential disruption during deployment, allowing developers work concurrently. Whenever feature development or fix creation occurs it is best that it originates within new isolated environment to isolate development from ongoing production deployments/releases of code.

Example branching is shown `feature/username-auth-updates`. All modifications, enhancements need branch creation before commencing modifications! All branching ought adhere strict format; with the prefix indicating feature, hot fix; to help categorize contribution during the code flow processes! Branch prefixes should accurately communicate contribution intent while collaborating amongst developers.


## <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>##13. Review Process
Submissions are reviewed to confirm functionality. Feedback can address any aspects like style conventions and code logic to enhance readability, performance optimization as per established Zenith best practices and quality guidelines for our development processes to maintain standards for our team. Please promptly incorporate and react accordingly when addressing suggestions. 

The response period can differ between reviewers (12h~72h is common expectation, please respect timelines); maintain transparency regarding the status during review by proactively keeping maintainers updated by addressing/resolving concerns and incorporating requested alterations promptly; as these facilitate faster review cycle between stakeholders while improving code stability over iterative refinements across development stages.   Review is critical for project quality assurance to safeguard functionality; consistency within all contributions before release to public or staging/dev platforms and ultimately helps improve code overall reliability within project scope and goals.

Once PR is successfully tested through all required automated processes, reviewed; then merged by project team member; it automatically moves onto the designated code integration environment to enable ongoing verification across the full application ecosystem.
