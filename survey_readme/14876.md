## Installation Instructions

First, you'll need to ensure you meet the project prerequisites: a C ++ 17 compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC), Qt 6.x development libraries, and CMake build system. It' s best to have a development environment set up before you install.

To begin, clone repository from the Git repository using the following:
```bash
git clone https:// github.com/ your-organization/ securevault- pro # Replace with your repository URL
cd securevault- pro
 ```

Next, ensure you've installed Qt 6 with the necessary modules for C++ development. This often involves using your platform specific package manager:
```bash
# Example using apt on Debian/Ubuntu
 apt- get install qt6- base-dev qt6- gui  qt6- network- dev
 ``` 

Create a separate build directory within the project' s root to organize your build artifacts. This keeps the main source directories clean and avoids clutter:
```bash
 mkdir build
 cd build
 ```

Then, execute CMake to configure the project. Provide the path to your Qt 6 installation if not auto- detected:
```bash
 cmake - DQT6_DIR=/ path/ to/ Qt6/ installation .. # Optional, specify Qt 6 path
 ```

Next is to create and install any external library requirements with their variables if applicable and build the dependencies before build SecureVault Pro with your chosen generator and compiler settings if needed and desired for optimization of performance for different system requirements:
```bash
 cmake -G " " # or " Ninja" for faster builds, if applicable

 make # On Unix-like systems, for building the executable
```

The generated installation file for Windows and the compiled package in linux can then be found after building and running installation files for their OS:
```bash
./install.sh # for the package manager in unix-like environment, after compiling it with CMake & "make" 
```

## Usage Instructions

After installation, run SecureVault Pro through your application launcher or execute the binary from the installation directory, or directly if installed on PATH

For file encryption, drag- and- drop your files or directories onto the main application window. Select "Encrypt Files" option within the file context menu for individual selections

For messaging encryption: Click on New Chat, and then choose which other party is receiving. Input messages will then get sent encrypted.  Decryption takes place locally after successful message transfer using public keys

You can also access our API by executing a simple command like "SVProtect /encrypt [filepath]". This requires installation into environment variable. It's intended to provide automated file encrypt/decrypt options within batch or other scripts . Ensure to provide valid arguments to protect data integrity, or to receive an accurate error report and message stating that an incorrect file location may have occurred during file path declaration for automation

We offer several command - line arguments to tailor file management and operations for efficient usage scenarios, and to automate the encrypt or decrypt actions. You may find additional information within Secure Vault's manual

We also plan future support for key - pair encryption and secure deletion. This feature has not yet been added

## Configuration

SecureVault Pro uses a central configuration file (`securevault.conf`) located in the user- home directory. You do not have to modify these directly unless customizing behavior for automated actions, and should instead do so in the interface, or the commandline interface (CLI).

Within this configuration file, settings for various encryption key algorithms may be defined to optimize performance on the users systems based on hardware, for both AES-256-GCM encryption mode. The key- derivation functions such as PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 is enabled

SecureVault utilizes environment variables `SV_DEBUG` to specify debug- logging verbosity (e.g., `SV_DEBUG=3`). Set environment to control debugging behavior and enable additional logs, useful to resolve complex technical issue. This should be kept disabled, except for debugging.

Custom paths for encryption- certificate and data key files should set using variables for secure vault to manage decryption operations with proper security controls. It supports multiple key files and is stored as plain - text. The path and access is encrypted within our database for added security . 

If running the app within an environment using restricted user how to create directories to allow it access. This directory is stored within config.  User can define this using `SV_STORAGE`

The encryption settings within our GUI and command line can be customized by specifying which type of hashing algorithm. It uses a salt of 32 Bytes by default which you can override using configuration options if desired for increased safety measures for added user privacy control and protection, which will then override all defaults. 

For the secure messages component of the suite, key exchanges are automatically managed for each new contact, eliminating user configuration for key exchange, and providing automated and encrypted communication, as a feature that simplifies usability while retaining privacy

## System Architecture

SecureVault is architected using a modular layered approach. The GUI provides interaction layer that utilizes QT components to facilitate easy navigation, encryption and data protection options, which are presented. Data is passed from our interface down to lower encryption module and back, to manage secure communication of sensitive and important actionable operations.

Below our presentation module are data abstraction layers and the encryption module with the cryptography and secure communications libraries which handles key derivations for encryption, data processing to manage and process all files to be stored safely on disk .  A core module is used, which implements all the logic behind SecureVault.  This ensures separation concerns within development, as we continue developing

Finally a database stores configurations for encryption and storage options for user access.  All components operate in memory as data and key files. The design allows for extensibility as our team continues development .  The key components of data flow consist encryption keys and sensitive values in RAM while minimizing data stored to avoid potential external threats

## API Reference

Our current public API is command line interface, which facilitates automated file handling with command execution.
 `SVProtect /encrypt  [file-path] `: Performs file encryption on the file provided at a defined `file-path` parameter, using `AES256_GCM ` encryption with auto derivation, storing in a encrypted archive, which requires proper user authentication .  It supports all valid windows/ Linux/ MacOS directories

`SVProtect /decrypt [ archived- file]`: Reverse process. Provides decryption functionality, requiring proper credentials to restore data in archive

The future versions may support HTTP based endpoint.
We're planning future version with a robust python library wrapper that simplifies API for easy scripting. 



## Testing

We use a `cpputest` to execute our code for various test environments .
Before running testing suite ensure that the required packages and environments were set and available, for accurate and robust test cases

To launch all test suites simply follow these instructions from a root terminal

`cmake -G  build
  make
 ./ tests 
`.

Our CI system executes all tests with the automated scripts, so you don`t have to launch any manual steps
If tests failed you can run tests to pinpoint what is going on and make necessary modifications as part of debugging. We recommend testing on many system architectures as this provides increased safety for cross platforms



## Troubleshooting

When launching app from terminal: If error " QT is not detected " check if the variable environment `QT6_DIR ` is set up

Incorrect path specification for the automation. Double check all pathing for all files or directories specified

When encryption/decryption: In case your files are derrived, it can signify an improper password provided by your account or user account

Incorrect configuration settings: Check your wither your file configuration is setup or missing partition. If that's the case try deleting config. If this occurs please contact our development for assistance



## Performance and Optimization

Currently our application uses multi- core support with optimized memory operations with our libraries

Our caching strategy minimizes redundant computations. Caching can also significantly reduce overall processing load on user systems, especially within high concurrency usage cases
Further future optimization can occur in parallelizing data encryption with SIMD, to further speed and optimize operations with user machine's system



## Security Considerations

Never share keys for data protection and encryption operations
Avoid insecure locations or network drives that can compromise your system

Keep the securevault installation on local devices for security reasons
Implement 2 factor-auth for your encrypted keys

For enhanced data isolation, utilize secure- erase to prevent accidental disclosure when files removed
Always validate external sources of encryption- certificates. Never run scripts of suspicious or unvalidated files
