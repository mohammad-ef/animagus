# Task Management Engine (TME)

This repository contains code, instructions, and supporting documents related to TME, a modular and configurable Python library facilitating the efficient organization, tracking, and management of various tasks, ranging from personal to professional workflows. The focus has been designed around ease of use, flexibility in integrating external tools like calendar and notification providers, and a robust internal data architecture that prioritizes data integrity even through edge cases of usage.

**Overview** TME is engineered to be easily integrated into various systems, offering a flexible core engine and a range of plugable extensions. Users can define task types with tailored attributes, set recurring schedules, track task dependencies, and automate workflows with integrated event hooks. A core focus throughout the project's development was designing around maintainability. 

**Target Audience** This library will assist individual productivity, software engineers, researchers organizing experiments, teams tracking projects or agile methodologies. We aim for a broad user base across a spectrum.  

**Core Components**
   * Task Core: Provides the foundation for task definition, storage, and state transitions.
    * Scheduling System: Handles recurrence rules for periodic task creation.
     * Plugin Interface: Allows for easy expansion of the library with third- party tools, such as integration with calendar services or messaging platforms. 
    * Reporting and Analytics: Generate detailed metrics about task performance, enabling optimization of personal or business workflows.

**Architecture** The TME is implemented using a microservice design pattern, where distinct modules, namely core functionality, schedule management component, and external integrations are deployed independently with well-defined APIs. Communication among these microservices utilizes a REST framework, facilitating seamless data exchange and modular scalability. The data is persistent in a relational database that can be customized, like PostgreSQL, ensuring data security and availability.

## Installation

The installation process should be straightforward, provided the dependencies are installed on the system first. It is advised to work with the project in a Python virual environments, to help with dependencies, as follows:

First, ensure that that you have python 3. 8 or superior and `pip` properly installed on you local or virtual environment. You could also consider a tool like `poetry` to manage the Python environment.
   
Next, using the `pip tool create a v env`, and make sure to activate this before proceeding, or the installation may not complete correctly, resulting in error code 1.  

```bash
python3 - m venv my_tme_workspace  # Creates a new environment
source my_ tme _ Workspace / bin ./ activate  #  On Linux/ macOS activate
my_tmeworkspace\ Scripts\activate  #  Windows activate

 ```

Now, install the core dependencies of the TME library.  It should also install all the other dependencies, and if the installation has issues, try installing the package again or checking the system. 

   ```bash
     pip install TME 
   ```    

If any errors occur during the process, it is often due to conflicts with previously installed packages, or the lack of build tools on the local system, in this scenario, the best option is to update pip and rerun the package installer to see if the issue can get addressed this way.   

We currently target Python 3.8 or later, on all operating platforms and we will continue to test for cross platform compatibility as the library matures to handle edge conditions.  

The library can be installed using `pip`, the Python standard tool package installer from within a terminal.  

## Usage

TME can be integrated seamlessly into a variety of applications. This example demonstrates some fundamental usage. 

First, import the required libraries, `task_manager` which is where the core logic of the package is located from the module `tme`

  ```python
import tme

# Create tasks and assign to a category
tm = tme. Task_Manager();
task1   = tm.add_task("Grocery Shopping ", "Shopping Category")
task2 = tm.add_task("Pay Bills", "Finance");
tm = tm.assign_dependency( task1,task2)
  ```

For more elaborate examples with schedule settings, and recurring settings, it is advised, to check the `tests` directory in the repository where multiple unit and integration test cases have been implemented to ensure functionality is operating as intended by the developers and that the user experience is not impacted when using the core functionality, extensions, or APIs. 

Advanced usage involves leveraging the plugin framework, extending the T ME engine with your own custom integrations, or creating complex event- driven chains using the event management system that can be configured.  

The task manager can be queried by category.  

```python
for task in tm.get tasks_by_type (" Finance"):
    print(task) # Display the task
    
tm.mark_completed(" Pay Bills");# Update the task status to complete, and store
    ```

TME also has a CLI tool available that can be executed with `tme - command` where `command can be help, status, or other custom commands`.  

You can configure it via a YAML or JSON file that will determine the behaviour, the location of the persistence, how the scheduler operates, and many other options.  

## Configuration

The TME's functionality is controlled using a configuration file, allowing fine-grained adjustments to its operational attributes. The supported configuration format is ` YAML ` files that allow human friendly configuration.

   To configure a task's recurrence, specify a " schedule " key in the configuration object, and then set the " interval " to define when a task repeats, the " duration " to specify the time of the recurrence and " end_date " to define a final date for recurring instances of a specific instance.  

You can override the database path and type, and customize the reporting and analytics. The location is ` conf/config.yaml`.  

The system relies on the `DATABASE_URL ` and a ` SCH DULE_ENABLED ` boolean value to ensure functionality in different environments, where the ` SCH DULE_ENABLED ` value will enable the scheduling and recurring events in the system, where the scheduler uses the ` APSCHEDULE ` module to run the tasks according to their specified recurrence patterns, enabling a seamless automated task handling workflow, where tasks get executed on a schedule.  

The system relies on the `DATABASE_URL ` and an ` EXTERNAL_PLUGINS ` environment variable. ` EXTERNAL_PLUGINS `  can list a number of custom plugin extensions, that can expand the library, to connect to services, like calendar and event notification, where plugins can be dynamically loaded and integrated into the T ME system, extending its capabilities without requiring code modifications, promoting flexibility, adaptability of the platform.  

You could override settings in a .env file or using environment variable settings to ensure proper configuration during development or deployment cycles of the application.

## Acknowledgments

The TME project acknowledges the significant contributions from the Python open- source community, especially the ` apschedule ` library for the scheduling capabilities, as well as the ` SQLAlchemy ` ORM library, where the data integrity, persistence, and database connectivity have been implemented with a solid foundation of the Python community contributions. We also extend a gratitude to other open- source projects, like the ` Py Test ` testing framework, that provided invaluable resources.

## System Architecture

 TME adopts a component- based microservice architecture, where each component handles a specific responsibility, enabling modularity and scalability.

   * **Core Engine:**  Manages task definitions, storage, and workflows. It handles the primary task- related operations like creating, updating, deleting, and executing tasks. 
    * **Scheduler:**  The scheduling component leverages ` apschedule ` to handle periodic and event- driven task execution. 
 * **Data Persistence:** Relational databases, primarily ` PostgreSQL` store the tasks, their attributes and schedules.
* **Plugin Interface:** Enables external integrations.

The components communicate via a lightweight messaging system or a REST framework, where data exchanges occur in well-defined contracts, which ensure interoperability and loose decoupling, which makes it possible to evolve components independently. Data flows through the system, originating from user-defined tasks, which are processed by the core engine, managed by the scheduler and then persisted in the database.

## API Reference

   The TME library provides a simple, yet effective API, enabling easy interaction with the core functionalities

*  `Task.create(task_name ,category, description, recurrence, due_date)`: Create a new TME task instance. Parameters are self-explanatory
* `Task . update (task_id, updated_attributes)` Update the attribute on an existing instance
* `Task . delete(task_id)` Delete a task instance by task_ identifier
* `get_tasks (category, date_range ) ` : Retrieve a list of tasks.

## Testing

Testing is a first- class component of the T M E library, ensuring stability and reliability.

We utilize ` pytest` for unit , integration and end- to- end testing. All tests can be run locally by executing ` pytest ` command from the project directory in a local environment.  

The testing suite includes unit tests, which validates each function of the TME, integration testing, where multiple components are tested together to ensure their seamless interactions.  

To run end- to- end testing, a set of predefined tasks are created, executed and validated, to ensure the TME is fully functional, providing a comprehensive testing and validation of core functionalities.

## Troubleshooting

   A few common issues have been identified that may arise during use, and solutions are presented here. 

*   **Dependency Conflicts:** If the installation throws dependency error. Upgrade to pip ` pip install  pip upgrade  - upgrade  upgrade `, rerun package and make sure the dependencies have not been previously modified to a specific version on another imported Python module, which may create issues, where upgrading may provide compatibility across packages or modules, ensuring the project functions correctly when using different components or extensions together
*  **Scheduling not Working** Double check if environment varibale`SCHEDULE_ENABLED` and is correctly enabled on system or deployment
*   **Configuration Error**: Double check configuration YAML, to confirm there isn;t missing values, wrong type for parameters

## Performance and Optimization

For optimized task execution and efficient management TME employs caching techniques and leverages concurrent operations whenever feasible. We utilize an asynchronous Queue that enables concurrent executions

Benchmarking and Profiling Tools, such as cProfile or py-instrumentation are available, enabling to optimize and monitor application, providing metrics on performance. We recommend that you use those tools, to help identify bottlenecks and opportunities, improving TME's responsiveness in complex usage patterns and environments. 

## Security Considerations

Protecting user data and the T M E's internal security are important. It's recommended to avoid putting keys and passwords directly on codebase as those can create significant exposure risks, if they end in public or are leaked somehow, which makes security of applications critical

Sensitive environment information and keys need to be kept separate using an env- variables management infrastructure

Input validation and sanitize the input from sources

Use a strong access policy and authorization rules that restrict user roles based on access requirements and capabilities, where user attributes need to adhere security policy guidelines before processing data for TME applications and services

## Roadmap

Here the current plan: 

- Integration with external notification system via web hooks to notify when a Task needs actions and when the Task completes execution 
- Adding a graphical Interface
- Improving data validation
