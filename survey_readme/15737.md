# PyStock - A Simplified Stock Market Analyzer

A Python application that analyzes stock data, calculates fundamental indicators and generates basic investment recommendations, aimed towards beginner- and intermediate-level finance enthusiasts.  It simplifies the overwhelming amount of financial data into a readable and understandable form and helps identify potentially profitable investing opportunities. The project's goal is education and accessibility, not professional trading advice.

## System Architecture

Py Stock uses a modular design, splitting responsibilities across three key components: data acquisition, analysis and reporting. First, a data scraping module gathers historical stock prices.  Next, an indicator calculation module computes technical & fundamental data, and finally, a reporting module produces visualizations and simple investment ideas based off the analysis. 

The application relies heavily on the `yfinance` library for stock data, `pandas` and  `numpy` for data manipulation and calculations, and `matplotlib` for charting. A configurable `config.yaml` file handles data parameters such as the symbols that are fetched and how many periods for calculations, which is then loaded upon launch to tailor data.  The overall data flow moves linearly, from stock price collection, to processing to finally visualization.

We leverage `requests` library within the scraping module for interacting with external data sources via their HTTP requests.  We also employ a basic caching system that will hold recent data within memory for increased application responsiveness; older cached data, however, is frequently refreshed in accordance with configurable frequency limits within the `config.yaml` document.  This ensures that our analysis reflects reasonably accurate stock data for our analysis to proceed efficiently.

To improve the overall robustness of our app, it uses exception handling techniques for various errors such as incorrect ticker values to improve usability when input validation errors or incorrect data values happen in our program, ensuring a smoother overall operation.

## 1. Description

PyStock provides a streamlined and approachable means of stock analysis, tailored to individuals beginning to explore stock trading strategies. Unlike complex professional systems, it prioritizes user clarity, featuring straightforward visualizations, minimal setup, and intuitive configuration, enabling a quick grasp of stock performance trends. PyStock is not designed to act as an automated trading engine or replace financial professionals' judgement, its sole focus is for users who may seek to enhance stock knowledge with basic data processing tools.

It allows you to monitor fundamental aspects like Earnings Per Share (EPS) alongside more typical financial figures like moving averages to help with a more holistic investment assessment. The analysis engine computes various ratios such as Price-to-Earnings Ratio, Debt-to-Equity ratio. It generates visualizations and reports on this processed information that allows quick comparisons to gauge investment attractiveness based on simple financial parameters. 

This app's design emphasizes simplicity while maintaining accuracy for essential analyses that will empower individuals seeking basic knowledge on the subject. By removing excessive jargon and intricate calculations it provides insights, while ensuring it can adapt across varied user requirements and data types to ensure consistent functionality in all situations. The user interface has an intentionally basic style with a minimal configuration to maximize user access to basic tools with a reduced initial overhead, while maintaining flexibility when it comes down to data analysis tasks.

It supports both single and batch stock data retrieval to support different investment assessment use cases that allow you to monitor and review individual investments as well as larger investment portfolios at once. Batch stock analysis can also facilitate quick comparison analysis across various sectors of stocks which are valuable if trying to analyze trends across various stocks for a diversified portfolio management plan. The batch analysis will then produce reports based on individual analysis that is aggregated and summarized within its presentation format for better insights to gain.

This app serves a purpose in educational contexts or by novice retail investors. This is an educational product meant to influence a greater appreciation of basic stock analysis tools without the overhead that can often lead users towards more overwhelming data or more advanced analytical strategies before being familiar with fundamentals, ensuring better adoption of knowledge. The design principles prioritize simplicity with clear insights for users who desire more control with less effort involved and with minimal configuration and overhead required in its overall application setup process.


## 2. Installation Instructions

To begin using PyStock, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. You will need pip to install any needed dependencies from our requirements.txt document and it can typically be found by navigating in command line into our application source folder to install our requirements using this `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Make sure your Python version aligns as the code may experience errors in execution with Python version prior to Python 3.8 because of some specific libraries it leverages within this app which requires newer libraries with specific API support. You will then require `virtualenv` installed in case the system doesn&#x20;t natively include that, and `pip install virtualenv`. After you install the virtualenv utility package we're using it's necessary that it be invoked as the environment that holds the python packages to prevent dependency problems between your current python installations on your environment versus your current PyStock requirements that can sometimes happen and can introduce unexpected application failures and behaviors when the wrong version libraries from other apps is leveraged.

The primary requirement for the system, `yfinance` is required that will provide the data fetching for the stock analysis module of this product; you might consider that this can take a decent period of time as well, which means that the user may see a slightly long time while this data pulls. `config.yaml` must also be present within the project's base root.  This file dictates which values that PyStock will analyze based off.

The data scraping library relies on `requests`, and this will be handled within our install dependencies process as described earlier; ensure there aren&'t no errors during that part as this may affect overall app usability when pulling and loading necessary historical prices that PyStock requires to proceed effectively and maintain the correct operation that PyStock will provide its core stock market analyzing services as its primary design need to be. The `requests` dependency will also enable handling various HTTP errors and response formats to handle dynamic websites that our program needs.

If the application fails due dependencies it is best to check all requirements from both your python versions you are installing with your operating system, along with verifying any network connection to download all needed resources from internet for all our needed modules in `requirements.txt` for the app, as that could potentially introduce failures as this process needs to connect and pull dependencies correctly to continue and execute properly, to allow all features available that it has designed as an educational product in finance to support basic knowledge with its features.



## 3. Usage Instructions

To initiate the application and perform a stock analysis you should run `python main.py` which will load configurations from `config.yaml` which defines symbols it analyzes along with calculation periods, for analysis, to be then visualized as plots. Then run from your application source base path to start our product that can perform data fetching along the necessary processing as its design is made out. Ensure to review `config.yaml` file ensuring you know which parameters the stock app works to configure.

By adjusting `config.yaml`, the number of analyzed periods, and list of the symbols the data analysis engine pulls will dynamically adapt for you to review a custom set that can tailor it better according to what needs for a more tailored experience. This will provide users the freedom for custom analysis that they are able to tailor and experiment based on different market parameters with drafting various analysis. For single tickers to monitor or portfolios of tickers the flexibility will be able to adapt for the various analysis and reporting.

If an analysis requires longer periods it could potentially lead to the program taking extended times and you're seeing delays in its data pulling processes; ensure internet speed isn&'t the bottleneck that causes that to be a slow-running scenario for our user. If it is running slow or errors persist ensure there aren`t other applications constricting bandwidth, which should ensure it has a consistent network performance as our analysis and report engine relies significantly to function as intended for its purpose and functionality of providing basic tools within financial insights in analysis that users would require for educational purposes,

The visualization will generate using the libraries `matplotlib`, where images for graphs of key technical metrics are rendered.  Ensure that this environment also has a compatible matplotlib configuration for the display and rendering as different systems might present with variations for visual aspects. If there is display-rendering related failure that is encountered during our app execution this means it could possibly have problems relating that to rendering of the graphs.

Advanced Usage, for users who are familiar can edit source, create additional functions, or customize analysis parameters. To create your functions to extend analysis or reporting you will then be able to incorporate those features as extensions to PyStock and enhance what you desire.  If that needs to involve external API usage it should adhere strictly within `config.yaml` and its design so you are not directly modifying source.




## 4. Configuration

PyStock utilizes a `config.yaml` file to control various settings. The default configuration specifies which stock symbols to analyze.  You should be in our source project directory and the configuration will default as the application begins when it executes as it loads the `config.yaml` and processes accordingly when the main module begins executing our data processes

This configuration is a key part as it is able to dynamically adjust what PyStock is designed to perform as the application runs based upon this data, as the parameters of what symbols it pulls for is controlled here; therefore ensure your `config.yaml` file exists or there is failure that would happen as we can no longer fetch the values for stock market to run the processes needed, which leads failure to execute for its purposes for providing education for the basic insights to financial aspects within analysis.

You may modify this to specify different periods that the data can use as it calculates various key values, and these values that is processed can then dynamically influence visualizations to progress with the settings of what data periods we can see within a stock and the data processing and visualizations for analysis as we perform for it to provide the necessary reports that is generated from the calculations and charts to allow insights in a stock.

Within `config.yaml`, it is able to adjust data-related aspects of this like caching periods and refresh times that influence our responsiveness that affects overall app behavior to enhance overall responsiveness in performance to minimize time for processing as requested from our application user. This provides users a level of control that enables a smoother user interaction as our application adapts accordingly to user and device performance as a dynamic system, minimizing any slowdowns as we pull stock and calculate for insights for educational purpose for financial data-related tasks and aspects

Consider also modifying `config.yaml` as the data requirements for different analysis may require a larger number for calculating metrics that has more math-heavy calculations which may then consume larger memory resources, ensure sufficient hardware that you possess when setting configuration. Also the file location needs to remain consistent as it needs a specific reference from `main.py` where the `yaml` module references and it is designed as an absolute requirement when our app starts, as this would fail as we are missing this crucial configuration and we cannot proceed with its design and purpose and features that we are built to do with this design of stock analyzing for education for beginners as intended in finance.




## 5. Project Structure

The project's source code directory, containing our code for all stock-related data and processes, resides under the "src" directory which will have the application logic, analysis engine along data fetching. This includes functions for retrieving the data, calculations on it and rendering it to be viewable from user as it processes for the data we're engaging on. All data visualization are rendered using the plotting modules for charts within a visual interface of matplotlib, so all these rendering processes happen within it and that can allow for different visualizations based upon configurations.

A separate directory is designated named the test, for running and maintaining unit tests. All of testing functions reside with this module that ensures quality in code execution and correctness, with the aim of providing confidence with the correctness that all the calculations we have made for this data and processes, that the user will find accurate when analyzing stock data from its educational-centric nature where our application has its purpose and goal within design for beginners learning about it, and ensuring correctness allowing our application to continue as reliable.

Configuration files reside at configs, where settings related parameters for data sources along stock selection are held in an accessible configuration, as a key aspect of our modular system that ensures our program behaves consistently across varying user configurations without requiring source editing directly as the application is meant for users to configure as easy-going, so we are minimizing complexity to maintain simple configurations and design for usability.

## 8. Acknowledgments

We greatly acknowledge yfinance and numpy & pandas packages which provided fundamental support in this stock analyzer that are critical in enabling its ability. The libraries provided us with necessary support needed from a core aspect which made data retrieval and manipulation much less complicated and allowed our program design, with minimal development effort, and the core focus is in visualization and usability which it enables. It provides the foundation we rely heavily and enables the education purpose that allows it function properly, as well to provide consistent data processing reliable.

Also acknowledge matplotlib libraries in which rendering visualization and graphical components in this application were built for educational insights of financial stocks insight analysis that allows user a view of key indicators as a user, using its libraries that provides a foundation in visualization of stock-related analysis, allowing us all stakeholders to view it easily, which are the foundation that provides the basis to ensure our users can have the education of how it works for a beginner's approach in visualization of key aspects and indicators for financial aspects to enhance knowledge in education and usage,

We appreciate those communities for these projects as involved contributors who helped to create tools used by the stock app, to further its educational purposes, to empower individuals for the better understanding of data processing in stocks analysis which allows it perform better and be reliable and useful in our application for all users involved who benefit from these insights, and knowledge and tools,




## 9. System Architecture

PyStock follows a layered artistic modular style, where we are splitting it up to have a modular and manageable code to maintain the core principles in our project that we have with it and to ensure scalability when it evolves with its features and functionality and to provide the users better and more reliable performance.

We begin with scraping where external headless browsers, through HTTP calls and API interaction with stock exchange sources and platforms are performed, with a data collection to gather stock-related prices which leverages libraries such as requests to make sure the interaction works well between our code and these websites we connect for gathering information to proceed to the subsequent step for stock data gathering that ensures a reliable foundation in the processes of stock analyzing and reports it can generate in insights and education purposes. 

After the data collecting the data analysis module calculates essential financial statistics using mathematical operations with core components in pandas which performs all these complex operations to produce financial indicators like the P/E Ratio as an indicator in fundamental data of analysis and key metrics that users may desire as an insight. We have then rendering that visualizes these results to create graphical interfaces using library of Matplotlib in an easy manner that helps the educational purposes of users as its core goal,

All of this data processing flows with clear separation and boundaries, so each process runs independent for a scalable modular design and it has its individual modules. Data caching enhances performance by storing data for reuse which speeds data gathering and minimizes unnecessary calls that would affect our program speed that can improve efficiency for overall execution and responsiveness as a core part to improve user performance of the product overall with our stock analyzing product for our user educational base of analysis to allow the program function smoothly without slowing the program down and affecting performance to maintain user expectations of responsiveness and ease,

This overall structure helps maintain modular and well documented data processes which makes future development easier in adding functionality and allows our program maintain consistent performance to benefit all contributors that is involved.
