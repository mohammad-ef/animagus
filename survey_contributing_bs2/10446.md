# How 
To  Contribute 

This document guides contributors who are enthusiastic to improve the project. Contributing helps enhance the software with novel features that benefit a vast audience and improves existing functionality through thoughtful improvements and fixes that ensure quality and maintain usability. 
We appreciate your support and collaboration in ensuring the continued success of this initiative. Both expert technical contributors or those who enjoy documentation or design are equally valuable.
 

We'd be thrilled for contributions that span various aspects from code and features to tests as also, design and content improvements to our documentation!

 ##Code 
of Conduct

 ## Getting Started 
 To 
begin contri 
buting, you' ll first require a copy 

of the codebase on a local machine. This is easily ach 

 ieva 



 bled using 



 `git 





 clon e <repository_ url> ` 







 Ensure Git 





 is installed and 







 configured 






correct 

ly on 

you computer before 

 proceed in 
g with th e process
  
 Once 

you have the project downloaded on y our computer 

navigate 

 to the root of t 



 he project o 

 d ie 





 recto. 

Then install the depend 



 e nc ie 






 s. 





 For ex ampl 



  e , use: 





 `n pm install` 





or if 

you 





 use 







 Python and 







 `pip 

 instal l requirements.txt 

 `



 We 





 use t he 

 `main ` br  an c h. 






 Please don't 

 directly 









 commit t o th is branch. Always branch off this branch for any contributions. 



 For local builds we require a Node 



 version of 1 



 6+. 







 If you 





  are running into issues you 



 should check our issues 



 tracker on 



 Gith ub 





. 







 
 To run the tests locally, simply run the command: `npm 



  tes t` or the appropriate command that aligns 
 with your project's testing framework. This command helps you verify that 


 your 



 contributions haven't introduced 





 any regression errors 
 or unexpected behaviour.

 ## 
How To 
Contribute 
 There are numerous 

 avenues in 



 which contributors 



 can assist. Reporting issues or 



 suggesting new ideas or improvements are welcome as is 




 submitting 





 code 

 contributions, as also 



 documentation refinement is encouraged. Your assistance makes a meaningful 



 impact.

 We always value feedback so 







 consider 




 discussing larger changes prior to 

 implementation. This allows for collaborative problem- 



 solving and helps align cont 

 ributio ns with the project's direction. Open discussions facilitate more effective 





  collaboration
  .

 Contributions should be submitted using standard 









 Git 





  flows
  , following best coding practices
  , 
and ensuring tests 







 pass and 







 code adheres 



 
 





 to 



 the defined coding st an da r da nd 





 guidelines

.

 We encourage everyone 



 who's interested in getting invol 



 
  ved t o 



 feel 



 welcomed and 






 encouraged to join.

 If 







 something' 







 s unclear, or 






 if 







 a contribution is not accepted, 







 feel 






 free to discuss it.

 We appreciate all contributions and are always 



 seeking feedback from 



  our community members. We are committed 





 to maintaining a welcoming and accessible 



 environment for contributors 






 of all backgrounds and 







  skills.

 If an issue is 

 found, it 





 will often 







 be helpful 



 to 




 create an example. 



## Reporting 
Bugs 

 When 
reporting an bug
 please provide a descriptive title that accurately summariz 





es the issue. Be 




 as spec 




 ific as possible, as it assists others to quickly 



 comprehend the situation. 



 Include steps on 



 how the bug is 



 reproduce, 





 which will make the bug much more 




 easy to debug for maintain ers. A clear, 





 concise description of what you expec 




 ted to 
happen is equally 

  important 



 to include. 

 Provide 





 your development 



 en 





 viro nment information, such 

 as 






operating system version and the 





 software version used. 

 This 



 will allow 



 us a better idea how to 



 reproduce 



  the problem, 
and helps us in resolving the 



  bug quickly
 .
 
 Report 







 all 







 bugs using our Gith ub 




 







 issues 
tracker at 




 <G it h u b 





 re posit ory URL> /. 




 Make sure the bug hasn 





't 
already been rep o rt 





 e d b ef 







 ore 





 submitting a new 





 one.




 

##Suggesting 
Enh an c me 
 nt

 We 
welcome and appreciate your suggestions to enrich our product. To effectively propose a new feature or enhancement, 

clearly articulate 





 the motivating 

 factors and 

  potential 





 us 
e 
cases, as 






 it is 





  vital for understanding the value of such 

  a change. Be sure the enhancement aligns with the project. 

 The maintainers 





  carefully examine and prioritize 





 all suggestions based 

 on factors. This helps to ensure alignment with 



 project goals and resources. 

 The maintainers also consider the level 



 of 




 effort versus 









  the value of implementing the suggestion 





 and 









 also 

 consider its alignment with 









 existing features and roadmap.

 When 




 describing 





 the feature, it would 







 be 
beneficial 






 to consider 









  providing 






 mock 





 ups 









 or wireframes.

 This is because it will provide a 



 visual aid for understanding the proposed design and 



 functionality, which can 





 assist maintainers to 





 quickly evaluate your idea.




 If possible also, 



 consider if any 




 existing features are related to your suggested 





 feature.

 Please submit enhancement suggestions 









 by c 



 creating 









 issues 
in our Gith ub 




 







 issues 
tracker at 




 <G it h u b 





 re posit ory URL> /. 




 Make sure the suggestions 





 have 



 n'





t 

 already b ee 







 n r ep or 
t ed 




 before 





 sub 







 miting a ew 
  one.
