# How I Build Awesome! (Contributions) 

This project wouldn your contributions greatly and help make a real impact for its future growth and improvement! This documentation guides your participation, covering essential processes from coding standards through to pull requests.

Contributions from individuals across many roles are welcome. We encourage anyone with the enthusiasm to share their experience in code or other support, to participate and become integral members within this growing collaborative community! We value all contributors regardless their experience with similar projects or their coding ability

By contributing and collaborating with fellow developers, you help make our project robust by improving quality of work and enabling more rapid improvements. Your work can improve user experience or even introduce features that are crucial toward future success.

 ## <br>1. Code and Communication 

We expect a safe collaborative, inclusive environment. We welcome individuals with unique ideas, regardless background experiences. This is a project where open discussion and sharing perspectives is essential.

Respectful communications must form the cornerstone. We are not tolerant toward offensive, threatening, disrespectful communications that undermine others within the group, or the collaborative nature within the development process. Disregarding this will unfortunately result to rejection of future submissions to maintain our environment. 

Disagreement on topics will inevitably occur and we will encourage a discussion to explore all options.  Discussions should remain civil and focused, always remembering to listen and learn from each other's ideas before offering feedback. 

## <br>2. Getting Started

To make an improvement or to fix a bug to your environment.  Firstly fork this repository, clone the repository to you machine and navigate within it with the terminal.  Subsequently use the following commands `git init`, `git clone <your_fork_url>`, then create a feature or `fix branch`. 

Before starting, set up an appropriate coding environment. Install all necessary language runtimes and any project dependencies as specified the project' instructions and/or `README.md`. This will allow the project to run, build and be executed correctly.

Create an environment and branch before you start contributing by using commands that allow isolation of your development effort from others. Using `git branch feature/<new_feature name>,` allows the project maintain to quickly merge your efforts.

Use `git status` frequently to check what your current changes, what files are staged or unstaged, as this can provide insights into the current workflow of the repository. This also enables an intermediate review of your efforts.

Once set up locally, you can use `npm install` ,  `mvn install`, `bundle install` or similar command, to resolve and install any dependencies needed for the project before starting any contribution to avoid issues during build and runtime. This helps maintain consistent project dependencies.

## <br> 3  How I Build Awesome Contributions

There exists different ways to help, beyond just writing code. From submitting suggestions to fixing documentation and submitting well written bug reports. Each of contribution types is welcomed and important, to the overall project. 

We encourage the submission of issues, describing bugs and feature proposals.  A bug report must contain enough detail about the issue. It can describe when the situation occurred and how one can consistently produce a problem and the expected vs reality output/action of the project in the scenario.

Improving existing code is also important and welcomed and will ensure quality of existing functionality remains robust. You could fix minor errors in functionality to address edge case issues, that may not even affect users immediately, to enhance stability

Documentation plays crucial role and often overlooked when developing any project. Improving, editing existing and adding documentation helps future contributor quickly integrate and onboard.

Please engage the team on bigger, architectural decisions and features that might involve changes or significant impacts of other project features to enable early collaboration, review and to address all considerations from a project's perspectives

## <br> 4 Reporting Issues

Before filing a bug report please first conduct some searches, it is common issue to be filed already and it helps keep maintainers organized

Your bug reports help improve overall quality! Make sure the information is complete: describe expected and actual behaviour; environment setup and how you produced an output with error

Ensure your problem is fully isolated: create reproducible code example to demonstrate problem. It's crucial the project can consistently and rapidly identify problem by replicating it on different system and configuration to resolve issue effectively

To efficiently handle bugs report them via the issue tracker. Providing all required details in one concise issue makes resolving the bugs faster to fix bugs more easily by the support and project teams 

## <br> 5 Suggesting Enhancements

To contribute to development, start suggesting enhancement through issue tracker or communication platform, clearly state the goal of improvement to enhance existing functionalty

Provide context, what problems the enhancement would fix or new opportunity would provide and explain why that is an advantage over current functionality in project. Describe what use cases are impacted, what user experience the proposed improvements bring in project

Maintainers carefully consider suggestions by assessing scope of changes involved. It also evaluates if aligns project strategic priorities to maintain focus, stability for the ongoing projects to ensure long term viability 

## <br> 6 Pull Request Process

Once code ready or documentation update completed submit pull request to repository using appropriate branches `feature/branch` or `fix/branch`.  The PR will enable review from multiple perspectives to enable feedback loop, which leads quality output.

Clearly and succinctly summarise changes made in description of the PR with the motivation and details behind implementation decisions. This ensures reviewer has sufficient detail before beginning the analysis 

Code style, functionality tests and documentation will undergo a automated check and if errors are found the code is not allowed merge in the main codebase. If changes required you will notified to implement the change before it will merge successfully

When changes reviewed, feedback received and code is green the PR can be merge, after this point, your efforts and work get merged to the project, ensuring that all contributors benefit.

## <br> 7 Coding Standards

All projects use standard style for formatting the language used through project and enforce consistent and standardized manner by using automated tool such linters or code formatter that check code against established convention

Use of appropriate code conventions enhances read ability for the whole team. Use of comments when appropriate will also allow easier review process by team, improving the efficiency of reviewing Code. 

All instructions should align well to standard conventions such Google, Airbnb. It's recommended that the language' standards or conventions are reviewed, which helps with code understanding

We enforce strict rules on type-checking by using appropriate type annotations to improve stability of the codebase while improving developer productivity, which reduces potential errors

## <br> 8 Testing Guidelines

The existing set of test need be reviewed prior any contribution before running to make ensure it runs successfully as a starting point

New test needs added, if you modify an area or adding function or component within project so the team have assurance and safety that new addition are well validated

Unit testing and Regression testing are both encouraged and will test each functionality blocks to enable quick resolution in event bugs and unexpected outcomes are discovered in new addition to existing feature or component of the program

## <br> 9 Documentation Contributions

Any change made within any file related documentation need reviewed by other team and contributors. Changes are required be aligned design standards as other areas to allow easier maintenance

Update or add relevant documentation within repository in specific folder where project documentation maintained such `/documentation/`, ``/docs/` directories. These locations allow team easily maintain, revise documentation for future updates. 

All pulled documentation edits must remain accurate. Clear instructions will guide contributors, and avoid ambiguity within instructions to ensure clarity when others read or implement.

## <br> 10 Commit Message Guidelines

Use of standard convention helps with code tracking as team and future maintainer quickly understands what was changes. The standard conventions helps in automated code tools to enable faster tracking

Prefixing with `feat:` (new feature), `fix:` ( bug fix), `docs:`(documentation edits). The message must provide summary, advantages and additional information to understand impact on code change and project in entirety

The messages are tracked to ensure that changes aligned and can easily understood by reviewer as the project evolve and grows as a collective team to improve quality of code base as project scales.

## <br> 11 Branching Model

Utilizing `Git Flow` approach allows branching to create a safe zone where changes can tested, merged before affecting main release stream or codebase

Main stream includes the production level, all releases happen via this and any modification is never directly done. Development is branched, from where other development and integration are done to test new code base.

## <br> 12 Review Process

Code review ensures consistency and code meets the team's standards of design to help reduce defects within project. Feedback are encouraged on every change and is crucial to learning

Timelines for providing a review feedback and addressing suggestions should aim to keep momentum as contributors move toward the final stage by providing quick feedback to enable continuous flow for team to remain aligned

When code changes have been addressed the maintainer approves and will merge the change with final commit, marking successful completion, as project progresses through all development stages 

## <br> 13 Communication Channels

We value community discussion through GitHub Issue Tracker which enables a place and platform to discuss and ask questions for all involved and engaged individuals in project

 Team maintains an online community where team members interact via Discord and slack communities. Discussions happen in these communities on project related activities or to seek immediate feedback 

## <br> 14 Security and Responsible Disclosure

If you identify a potential security bug avoid immediately posting online and directly report to a dedicated mailing list with all details for a confidential response. We prioritize resolving these quickly! 

Report with detailed steps to produce issue along and all affected files involved so team is enable identify and remediate vulnerability and reduce the potential impacts of such bug.

## <br> 15 Release Process

The maintainers manage frequent releases of updates, improvements. Each version has its version numbers, allowing easy management for consumers

Changelog updated for version numbers delivering detailed overview what has altered for all version and what new functionallity, fixes, updates included with new changes 

## <br> 16 Recognition

Contributor name are acknowledged within the repository in a specific acknowledgement and thanks sections in code base.

The contributor's input acknowledged by adding them within a contributor listings page that showcases contributions within each version. Recognition helps maintainers and contributors celebrate and share accomplishments with the community

## <br> 17 Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To legally allow usage within code and for future distributions a Contributor License Agreement will ensure proper legal protections, and ensure code usage can continue without conflicts and concerns 

Link and details will available and provide the process on reviewing, and agreeing legal agreements before the code becomes integrated, ensuring everyone adheres to proper licensing requirements

## <br> 18 Resources and References

Reference Google, Python' standard guidelines and PEP-8 standards, that will enhance understanding within community of best practices for the projects code style

Utilizing online community resources helps to enable collaboration. It encourages contributors learn best practices within community of peers by sharing insights for continuous project enhancement
