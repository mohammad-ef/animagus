# CONTRIBIUNTING Guidelines - Your Help Makes Project Awesome!

We so value the work that contributes back into the project to maintain the highest levels of standards and quality possible within the software. Your time, feedback & effort in assisting us to improve Project Awesome is highly appreciated and essential. We encourage all levels of contributions and hope to build a robust open community for all users.  Welcome and get involved in improving our project together today!

Project contributors are the lifeblood of open-source, and this document details how you can get involved with our project. We believe the more perspectives the more innovative the outcome will become and the better suited for all involved users. Whether fixing simple bugs, contributing features and or documentation, every little contribution matters!

This file details all aspects of contribution for Project Awesome, from bug reports and enhancements to the final merge. It's our goal that the steps outlined make the contribution workflow clear and seamless to get your work included. 

## 1. Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please ensure you' ve installed Git.  Then, you can fork your account by hitting the Fork button. 

Now create a new branch based on main or develop. This branch keeps your work isolated. Use something short & sweet eg:  `git checkout -b feature/add-button` 

To setup Project Awesome in your machine clone your own repository with: `git clone https://github.com/<your_user>/Project-Awesome`. You then should go to that location in your console `cd Project-Awesome`

Run installation `npm install` if you used `npm`, if the case may be, or another package installer of your choosing, `pip install`, `conda install`.

## 2. Code of Conduct

We want to cultivate a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, and the first step towards doing that is establishing ground rules of behavior and mutual respect. This means being inclusive and supportive and offering helpful guidance where appropriate, and always assuming good faith from the community members, including ourselves.

All project participants, regardless of skill level, background, gender, identity and/or background must abide by our Community Guidelines: Respect everyone at all times; refrain from discriminatory comments or any form of bullying and promote open & supportive communications within the community.  Failure to follow these guidelines may result in warnings, removal from communication channels, or a ban from contributing to the project.

The purpose is for the open collaboration for building something useful to a broader community with the highest ethical & social standard of care in every decision we implement as well in our communications within Project Awesome contributors and wider community being the main focus. Let us always maintain and uphold a healthy working atmosphere within all contributors, maintainers and stakeholders within our Project Awesome.

## 3. How to Contribute

Contributing to Project Awesome is welcomed from anyone willing to dedicate a small portion of their free time! You can help through writing documentation to creating a whole feature and more - it doesn\'t take that much to have an impact and all assistance goes towards helping our open-source software become something truly fantastic!

We are happy for you to report existing issues to us, even small bugs! This can assist us and future development efforts and allow a smoother development workflow later onwards for the rest of the maintainers & contributors as the Project evolves over time!

Feature enhancement ideas & new features also are more than welcomed for our open contribution workflow; please use feature requests via creating issues for a streamlined & quality review from all members. Create Pull requests once code & tests complete, as it allows us easier to merge your assistance into our open codebase to further improve Project Awesome

## 4. Reporting Bugs

We want our code to function properly. As a project with contributors across a broad audience, issues arise & bugs do get into our software! If something unexpected does come across your screen and doesn\u2019t function correctly without the intent for that specific mechanism or functionality, it can be very easy to report these errors!

Report these via a detailed explanation of what was intended for it do and a step-by-step guide in a way others are also able to reproduce that very scenario, this greatly reduces our turnaround response to fixing the error as it gives all the relevant info at the very first point, this streamlines development for us greatly, improving the open source software! 

When writing out this description be concise yet complete in details of expected vs outcome to provide the context to better address what might occur, which assists us as much as it allows a quicker debugging process in which a quick patch can come to light! This is the process by which a fix to Project Awesome happens in its continuous cycle.

## 5. Suggesting Enhancements

We love suggestions from you. To provide suggestions, simply raise the suggestion into an open Issue labelled appropriately so the relevant team members & stakeholders will see that request & address the issue!  It also helps us to prioritize those enhancement based work requests as per their urgency

When proposing features include detailed motivation and a possible case for its inclusion within Project Awesome. What is driving you toward it & the problem is intended to resolve with, and who will benefit and how, these help in evaluating whether this aligns our project and what value to our overall mission and goals are intended?

Review will include a discussion with all contributors as this provides more clarity and ensures no conflict within the existing project and allows to refine your request and incorporate any further details and improvements!

## 6. Pull Request Process

We welcome contributions to the main development branches. First fork, set-up branch with feature, implement, create tests with a clear, succinct, descriptive comment! Submit that pull request to our Project. Please ensure the pull request title includes an abbreviation for your feature and fix. (eg "fix/issue123, or feature/implement-user").

The code style should comply to the established rules of this codebase. The pull request must be able to run & successfully compile. If your contribution does need further changing & refinements then the maintainers are entitled to suggest improvements to align code with current best practice.

If changes and refinement do require changes after feedback is reviewed. Please make your changes within your forked pull request so they will get reflected on your request, which makes tracking progress and merge decisions smoother than ever for a great contribution and streamlined development. Upon Project approval your pull request with pass the automated test suites for approval, merging, which makes our software all the more maintainable.

## 7. Coding Standards

Code should adhere to consistent guidelines & standards of formatting for ease in code reviews! Code should also use standard formatting specifications and naming for better readablitly within code base

All contributions are subject to a standard set of automated tests which check the coding for quality! This automated check can include things from syntax correctness, formatting consistency and documentation, ensuring high standard across our software. 

Use our configuration `.eslintrc.js` file or equivalent for linting purposes; ensure you check the documentation within the tool for all specific configuration and rules to be enforced! 

## 8. Testing Guidelines

Tests can come in three core formats; the very first one will check the correctness, secondly tests verify if functionality functions within certain parameters of inputs; the third one ensures no unintended behavior when a change comes. Unit Tests verify each isolated component or functionality within project, integration verifies the communication within those modules; regression will catch errors & inconsistencies from previous code changes to avoid introducing any regressions

Before you create the pull requests ensure that there exists comprehensive set of existing testing suite; run them all! Add unit tests as a minimum to demonstrate your change works properly!

All tests and code needs be tested to pass on all test frameworks and environments supported before submission into code repository, which provides peace of mind in the long term maintenance cycle!

## 9. Documentation Contributions

Project Awesome thrives by clear communication!  All contributors have opportunities to assist through providing better descriptions of functionality. This allows users and helps with new maintainers joining our awesome group to quickly get acquainted in all aspects within.

Existing doc pages should all exist on `docs/`. Feel free to update them or add documentation pages that may have existed before but weren'\u2019t documented before, which allows better understanding across the team, as this allows quicker debugging, feature requests to become more concise with details for maintainers or any new team-joiners!

When writing or contributing ensure clarity & conciseness for the entire Project Awesome community to assist them and improve ease and use with all our project functionalities! 

## 10. Commit Message Guidelines

A consistent commitment to descriptive, clean commitment helps with easier understanding within code-repository as time advances for our future developers

Follow strict conventions for commitment, use imperative, present tense verbs like 'fix' rather than statements! Prefix commits as such 'feat:', 'fix:' to categorize what change occurred with that very commitment

We utilize conventional commit style as the project grows; for example 'fix: address minor bug in the database module', it provides better tracking with lots and clarity for our team, as they are more humanly and easily-digestible, rather than abstract notes, that provides better overall project clarity across time-horizon

## 11. Branching Model

The recommended and most widely accepted practice is for our Project, is a trunk-based flow model! This allows for a simpler workflow as changes will go in as soon as possible

Branch off the 'main' directly when implementing feature changes, always merging the 'main' to catch changes that may exist as they evolve with ongoing improvements to avoid merge complexities and conflicts that may happen later when merging your work into our open software source

If working with others ensure clear discussions for all stakeholder involvement as a team, as the goal will assist for better understanding & collaboration across team to build great products!

## 12. Review Process

Contributions and changes need thorough reviewing process and validation prior merge approval so our project maintain code-base high and robust

Reviewers may provide constructive comments that require you making adjustments within your pull requests and refining to be more concise! After that, maintainers run a final test, after this approval your changes merge! 

Feedback will include things on style guidelines as we discussed, test case validations & any other potential bugs or areas needing to have improvements, so the end-result will become an excellent code quality that benefits us & our awesome users for a prolonged lifecycle! 

## 13. Communication Channels

Reach our community of contributors, and project-maintainers through various platforms and means.

Feel free to ask & discuss on open Issues on github repository; this is public so that any member of Project can provide assistance to help solve issues! For more in-depth or custom discussion feel free to communicate directly to any of our core contributor/ maintainer team!

All discussions on open platforms will assist us as it helps all contributors as we improve the product with each others' feedback as this creates great & open collaboration for Project Awesome community & team.

## 14. Security and Responsible Disclosure

We are highly vigilant regarding safety within security concerns for open Project, please help report it responsibly if encountered. 

Please DO NOT share details in a very public forum and instead communicate through dedicated communication means (GitHub issue or direct to project-lead); it's very essential and helps us to properly mitigate potential harm from malicious attackers!

The project will then promptly and appropriately investigate, resolve it & communicate the solution to all involved contributors. Security of code remains the absolute top-most and paramount priority in any development and deployment of project-software & related resources to the open-software environment!

## 15. Release Process

Version numbers increment as we evolve new & enhanced capabilities.  New Releases & versions get released after significant code & features change and/or stability and safety fixes come to be within codebase

Releases require tagging that commit as 'versionnumber - e.g, 'v1.0.0' and creating an entry with changelog which highlights the important and noteworthy improvements for all user base! The project then goes and is deployed in the environment as it's set, so end users quickly can utilize new capabilities that come out as it becomes a stable and ready state.

Ensure semantic-version gets properly used to provide all consistent & understandable change logs as this impacts users & their software dependencies and expectations of future functionality

## 16. Recognition

As an important contributor you can expect your work and contributions listed under our Contributors' pages within documentation

Additionally our open community acknowledges everyone involved through public recognition in project communications, such as our website!  This is our thanks, a public expression that we value the contribution for making us all stronger & awesome

## 17. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

If the open codebase uses third-party software & resources with their own respective copyrights it's required we need CLAs from contributors. It grants legal right, for open-community software. 

If this process becomes a requirement for Project Awesome, please look forward to receiving a direct communication and a clear guide on how best complete and execute! We greatly encourage and value all open contributions as this will only further enhance the Project Awesome ecosystem.

## 18. Resources and References

Please review all available references to help better align contributions

We have included our project code styles within this very document! Feel free to check this for best guidelines for your own implementation, which is consistent and high quality
