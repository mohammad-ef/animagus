# How to contribute

## Working on the code

* Install [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) and run `pre-commit install`
  once to make sure checks are executed before committing.

## Submitting changes

* Create a PR targeting the `master` branch.
* Give a short summary of what the PR is about.
* Keep the history of the feature branch clean while working on it. Rewriting
  the history in feature branches is allowed and encouraged (use `git rebase`).
