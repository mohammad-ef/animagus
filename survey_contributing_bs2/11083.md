# Contributing to RetroZilla
## Git Branches
* `master` - Current stable release
* `beta` - Most of the time a mirror of `master`, this branch is used in the days leading up to a release.
* `nightly` - The working branch of RetroZilla, this should be used as the target for pull requests
* `oldmaster` - The original master branch, obsolete and provided for historical reasons only. Does not build.

## Contributing:
Pull requests must be submitted to the nightly branch, and all messages/titles for PRs/commits must be descriptive. All code should be well commented and easy to read, and retain the style and indentation of the source document. Please try to keep commits self-contained as much as possible. Pull requests can be submitted to fix existing bugs, or to add new features.

***Please check back to this document from time to time for updated standards***
