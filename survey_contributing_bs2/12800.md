# CONTRIBIUNTING Guidelines - Your Help Makes Project Awesome!

We so value the work that contributes back into the project to maintain the highest levels of standards and quality possible within the software. Your time, feedback & effort in assisting us to improve Project Awesome is highly appreciated and essential. We encourage all levels of contributions and hope to build a robust open community for all users.  Welcome and get involved in improving our project together today!

Project contributors are the lifeblood of open-source, and this document details how you can get involved with our project. We believe the more perspectives the more innovative the outcome will become and the better suited for all involved users. Whether fixing simple bugs, contributing features and or documentation, every little contribution matters!

This file details all aspects of contribution for Project Awesome, from bug reports and enhancements to the final merge. It's our goal that the steps outlined make the contribution workflow clear and seamless to get your work included. 

## 1. Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please ensure you' ve installed Git.  Then, you can fork your account by selecting 'Fork' option and cloning down the source to work locally! The next is the set up of environment with installing of required dependancy libraries, as specified. You'll use Python3 or a specific package.
  
 A local installation involves creating a ` virtual_environment`. It keeps Project Awesome dependencies seperate, so it wont impact any runing applications you have set up elsewhere!
 `python3 -m venv .venv`.

 Next install required packages with this pip installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`. You should install and build your changes to see any tested updates and improvements locally

Finally activate your local project virtual environment and run the tests. You'll see which components fail to test correctly or work properly to diagnose and improve upon them! `source .venv/bin/activate` & then follow up to include all of these tests and updates as pull requests after testing thoroughly

## 2. Code of Conduct

We strive to build a respectful and inclusive community around Project Awesome. All interactions must be positive, respectful, and considerate of others. Discrimination, harassment, or any other offensive behavior will not be tolerated.  Remember to approach discussions here critically but in kind as everyone is working for one outcome

We want to ensure all users feel empowered drawing their contributions. Disagreement may exist between ideas on implementations and direction however these differences will not affect the respect given. Any behaviour that makes people feel unwelcome or discouraged should be promptly reported as soon as they become apparent!

Failure to adhere to this code of conduct may result in removal from the project and further reporting of the violation if deemed applicable for severity or repeat incidents.

## 3. How to Contribute

We encourage you to explore ways you can make Project Awesome better, whether technical or not. This can be bug reporting and enhancement submissions through issue and pull request systems.

Submitting bug reports that detail clear reproduction is vital, especially if steps to recreate can lead a new developer down a rabbit hole of frustration trying to capture the cause or source of failure. This helps improve code maintainability by preventing future errors from happening again. 

Documentation contributions such as tutorials and guides help to increase community understanding and usage for end users, and the ability for people to use this open software more often, for various cases! 

Finally contributing code and enhancements can help build and create new functionality within Project Awesome. All changes go through testing procedures as detailed later in these documents and will get incorporated based on their value

## 4. Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a bug report, make sure the issue hasn 't already been reported in GitHub Issues. Use the search function thoroughly, with a good description for a good chance to reduce redundancy and confusion in multiple submissions

Create a clear and concise bug report describing the problem in details on its impact on usage. Be explicit and provide details and what your were doing at the time when encountering these error. Include error messages as much information available for better diagnosing purposes from our maintainer and other involved engineers

Most crucially include step-by-step instruction with the context to recreate. If the error does arise due to some specific circumstances please highlight this, so engineers know how best capture and address them to fix this bug or potential vulnerability issue quickly. This makes a bug much more fixable.

## 5. Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea to improve Project Awesome? Please propose your suggestion. Clearly outline motivation by explaining what problem or opportunity is it trying to fix. The suggestion is more helpful with specific example to showcase how your enhancement might work or how end users would benefit, especially those less tech savy

Before implementation try engaging our core team with the ideas by submitting the request into discussion and open for feedback on the proposed implementation. A conversation and shared discussion can result in the optimal way to incorporate it and what edge case or potential issues that needs attention before implementation

Finally maintainers and project leaders consider enhancement submissions. Prioritization takes several criteria including feasibility complexity and how closely it relates and contributes to core Project Awesome objectives to maintain a focused and cohesive goal in software quality improvements!

## 6. Pull Request Process

After creating your changes to fix, implement feature enhancements etc, you need submit as pull request! First be sure ensure changes work and run all existing test. You need branch off the master for any new change to avoid direct conflict on production branch
 
  
Create the Branch `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`. Also include the branch as descriptive with its specific intent of contribution and purpose. Then submit as merge to a specific review channel for testing

The PR is tested by engineers, if any tests pass it is accepted in codebase to maintain and keep project code clean

All pull requests must have the following
1. Descriptive and concise description with a good title
2. Reference issues, with specific fixes
3. Resolved code and unit testing, no conflicts or issues detected!

## 7. Coding Standards

Maintain consistency and high quality through adhering these rules
All Python code follows Google-Style guides (see link to resources)

Use of a static linter (flake8 and Pylint, etc). All commits require code checks prior, as a preventative maintenance
Docstrings* all Public code to make maintainance simple as documentation is always key in code maintainment

We also use a Standard of semantic versioning, for each release with new versions and bug releases as part of this code maintainence standard for quality purposes

## 8. Testing Guidelines

Project Awesome uses Python and unit, and system integration tests! The testing framework is set to be standard and follow testing practices for all code commits that pass all the testing requirements, before submission to main branch

We need comprehensive unit tests, for each module/feature with tested functionality to avoid code regressions
Regression and system integration testing will check and capture any new issues, with integration with third party APIs as applicable with updated documentation.
Test all failure paths for all edge conditions! This helps to ensure high reliability across use scenarios

## 9. Documentation Contributions

We encourage you all contributors for updating any and or improvement for at Project Awesome.

All code documentation and usage examples can improve product understanding to users of the project for easier and efficient onboarding for the new and experienced. This is vital, in helping others get on the tool to contribute!

Documentation for any third party integration, APIs usage, deployment steps can improve quality and adoption! 

Ensure consistency between code, usage samples & API usage!

## 10. Commit Message Guidelines

Each git commits needs meaningful context on its contribution! 

The project requires following conventional commits.  The commit messages will be standardized by type:
 * **feat:**  Introducing new features
 * **fix:** Fixing bug, errors/
 * **docs:** Document changes 
 * **style:** Code improvements
  
Write clear descriptions: What the fix/enhancement did! Explain any dependencies involved!
The subject has less than 50 charcters
Body can expand to add further information for developers to maintain this

## 11. Branching Model

Project Awesome employs simple version control method
* Develop/feature branching
All feature/new contributions are developed in new, unique Branch from develop, named like 'Feature/[briefDescription]

Main Branch always reflects a current tested product with release versions!
Never work direct to Master and use the main branch directly as it will cause huge issues. Pulls need thorough code check before being merged, especially if the merge conflicts and/or fails to compile!

## 12. Review Process

Every change needs a pull review before integration. All designs must follow our code style guidelines, tests passed with code compliance

PR Reviews can have one, 2 reviewers before code integration to the main codebase
We strive on prompt responses, usually in a few business days. If a response has taken over, feel free follow up, but avoid nagging as we'll get there and appreciate collaboration
If feedback received doesn 't work then, raise your own concerns for resolution! It should lead towards better solutions, not hurt feeling.

## 13. Communication Channels

The core project uses [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AwesomeProject/discussions) for all project conversations and design discussions, and feature planning

If need any support and urgent requests for the issues with Project Awesome. Reach our support channel by opening [issue tickets](https://github.com/AwesomeProject/issues).
Be explicit, provide as much context for the maintainance teams so issues gets fixed! 

## 14. Security and Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate and support a community that values code safety for our contributors.  All code should run secure! All vulnerability and potential safety flaws can reported via secure reporting method at:  [email protected] or by contacting Project Lead, with no publicly shared disclosure before confirmation by our team, 

Security vulnerability disclosures must provide details for us and a method to address quickly

## 15. Release Process

When new functionality/bugs fixes and testing completed, Project Awesome releases happen as new versions (semver version numbering - x.y.z ) with release documentation. Tag releases on `vX.Y.Z` on `master`. Create Changelog, and release to public repositories for everyone use. Release versions are fully backwards compliant unless otherwise mentioned so as it does not interfere current use of product for everyone using

## 16. Recognition

Your help is vital in maintaining high product, as contributors will have credits added on GitHub repo in the readme and any release documentation as applicable with all their effort! This helps the Project get adopted faster! If a significant enhancement has taken over the quality and performance improvements for our product we may provide awards to those! This also builds a better sense of the community to improve and grow
