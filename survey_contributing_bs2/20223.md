# Contributors Guildeline

## ** 1.Introduction **

We warmly invite you  to contribute!  Your involvement is instrumental in helping us evolve our codebase and shape the future of project. By adding your expertise, you are directly supporting our project's goals.   

Contributions are vital for maintaining a dynamic, reliable , and innovative platform. Whether you' re a seasoned dev or have a new set of eyes, your insights are valuable for improvement and innovation! 

We embrace and appreciate all contributors, both through code contributions like bug fixes to non-technical efforts such as improving documentation or suggesting design enhancements - your contributions make a big difference! We believe a strong contributor community helps the open source software succeed.

 

## **2. Code of Condact**

We are committed to cultivating a welcoming and supportive community for all those involved in this endeavor. This includes treating each individual with kindness and showing empathy. We are a diverse community with varied backgrounds and viewpoints which must be respected. 

We expect all contributions will be delivered with professionalism, courtesy, and a constructive attitude. Respectful communication, active collaboration, and a steadfast dedication to inclusivity will be the core values within these communities of people. 

Disruptive and disrespectful behaviors will not be tolerated. Actions, such as harassment, discrimination and intimidation will have serious consequences, including removal from the project and potential legal measures to maintain our safe, welcoming environment. 

 

## **3.Getting Started**

To begin, make sure you install all dependencies, which are described in the documentation. Clone our repository by using the following:

```bash
git clone [Project Repo Link]
``` 

Create a new branch to work on your features. Always branch from the  `main` branch to keep your changes aligned with the latest stable code: `gitcheckout -b feature/my-feature`. This allows you to easily isolate your new functionality, ensuring stability for all other contributors.

Next, install dependencies using `npm install` and run the project using `npm start`. This command initiates the local build process, making the application executable and view the changes.  Feel free to modify the code and start submitting your contributions!

Before submitting anything make sure you follow our coding and formatting standard (covered in more detail later) to keep the codebase consistent. Finally, test your work extensively to ensure there are no regressions before sending your work to our maintainers!



 ## **4 How to contribue **

 There are many avenues for involvement! Submitting issues for problems you find can be a great way to contribute. Providing feature suggestions or ideas can also drive innovation and project direction.. 

 Of course, direct code modifications are a key contribution. This includes fixing bugs, introducing new features, or refactoring existing components. Always make sure you follow our coding and formatting standard for a smooth merging process.

 Don't overlook non-code contributions! Improving our documentation, updating the README file, or even helping with community moderation are valuable contributions. Every effort, large or small, is welcome to make this the best open source project!

 We strongly recommend discussing larger planned changes with maintain team through opening an issue or starting a discussion. It ensures that we are working towards the same project goals while avoiding redundant efforts. This can save valuable time and ensure a more effective contribution

 

## **5 . Reporting Bugs**

We encourage you to report bugs to ensure project stability and user satisfaction. When submitting a bug report, provide as comprehensive information as possible. This can help expedite the debugging and fix processes, ensuring a smoother development workflow .

 To create a reproducible example include the exact steps to reproduce the bug, including any relevant configuration and sample data that triggers the error to our issue tracker on GitHub . A concise and detailed description is critical for a quick response.

 All new bug reports need to be created on our [ GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-github-org/your-project/issues). This allows us to track, prioritize, and manage bug fixes effectively. Please use a clear and descriptive title for each submitted bug.   

 

## **6. Suggest Enhancements**

 Got a vision for a new feature?  We'd love to hear it ! Submitting well considered feature suggestion is a great way to contribute to future of project. 

 To help us evaluate your enhancement, be as specific as possible. Detail motivation behind the feature, how it solves a pain point, or provides a new functionality for users. Providing some potential use cases is also helpful.

Our maintainers evaluate suggestions based on factors such as alignment with the overall project roadmap, impact, complexity, and effort required. Not all suggestion make it into code and feedback regarding these submissions can occur to provide rationale and transparency to the process

 Please share all the suggested features and changes to be tracked on [ GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-github-org/your-project/issues). This provides visibility for all members to review ideas or suggest related improvements

 

## **7. Pull Request Process**

 When working on an enhancement submit code in new `Pull Request`. Start by creating branch for the new changes and name with prefix. (ie) 'fix/', 'feature/'), 

 Commit often with meaningful message.  Splitting a feature change up into several commit is more easily and helps review process and easier revert back changes as needed .  Before creating Pull request run tests locally

 Create a new pull request and link branch back into 'master' (Or main), and include descriptive message that describes what change it implements or addresses 

 We will thoroughly review pull request with focus of coding conventions and testing before we can approve changes into main branch.. Be sure you review the code in your request before pushing and follow us as possible toward code standard and guidelines



 ## **8. Coding Standards**

 We believe maintaining coding consisten and clear will increase the overall codebase reliability, readability, and long-term maintianabililty of code for future contributors 

 All new submissions require to comply and respect code indent of spaces. The coding standards are outlined to improve collaboration of team as the standard is followed by every contributers. 

We leverage a number of static analyers to check code style (ESLint), and code flexibility, such type checking with tools (TSlint/TypeScript, MyPy), and comprehensive docuemnation using (JSDoc, Doxygen). Configuration of this standards found on `/.eslintrc`, `.tshintrc`, and other related documents.

We recommend use an auto code format on IDE. (Such, as  Prettier). Using such autoformat tools helps keep codebase consistency by automatically format all the changes you push and maintain readability for future development!  This ensures consistent coding practice, regardless individual's coding background

 

## **9. Testing Guidelines**

 Comprehensive unit, integrations test ensure reliability project's codebase for all new features. We want our product reliable with little chance errors will happen to all sorts developers. 

 We have an suite existing automated unit testing frameworks like Junit for our Java projects or Mocha, Jest Javascript projects. To add a test create and add in folder with naming pattern which corresponds to feature that the code test is testing!

 Writing test coverage across all aspects of product. Aim reaching over eighty percentage coverage with a minimum. Unit, and integrateion are critical. We welcome Regression and performance benchmarks for our backend to help maintain our quality over the project

 

## **10. Documentation Contributions**

 Accurate and updated documentation is vital user and developers to engaging product effectively, improving user experence and adoption. This can increase engagement. 

 The source files can live and stored under folder in `docs/`. It will need a build to make sure that changes reflect onto main project. The documenations should also reflect latest version

We appreciate edits on existing docs. We need documentation be written with concise explanation. Please review for grammatical mistake for clarity! Avoid unnecessary technical jargon, to reach broader group of developers.



 ## **11. Commit Message Guidelines**

 Clear concise commit are vital understanding changes in a team of developers over project development life cycle . Commit help keep record of the evolution. 

 We are following [conventional commit convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) that helps describe and label changes within project history using standardized prefixes to provide better readability! Prefix can describe changes, which are (Fix: to bugfix and feat to feature, refactor or test to test cases.) 

 Proper formatted message is helpful for generating CHANGELOG file and automate versions and tracking. Consistent message improve code history understanding to maintain code health over time. 

 

## **12. Branching Model**

 Project utilizes standard Git-Flow strategy which enables a smooth workflow for managing and organizing new contributions . Branch strategy provides structure in overall process of managing the source control for this product.

 The  'master' represents latest version which always needs be production grade . For features development always created separate feature-branch for each change

 Before creating pull requests make a pull request for merging to the master . Always create branch to test and make the process more organized to ensure code production and development can co-exists in one place 

## **13. Review Process**

 All the code changes need undergo comprehensive process of quality assurance by a designated reviewers on project's code quality 

 Maintainers thoroughly reviews submit and code to make that standards of product is maintained as expected. Be receptive to suggestions for change that might come and be respectful towards maintainers who have more knowledge to project and its needs 

 Changes get reviewed, merged when they satisfy all expectations from standards, code coverage testing and all related concerns . If change needs more modifications will require re submission and feedback until all requirements meet

 

## **14. Communication Channels**

 Feel free and comfortable communicate any project question with community members and developers to facilitate better development collaboration!   It can help clarify requirements of feature requests

 Discussion happen on  `Github issue page for specific issue,` we also use Slack to have fast communication to discuss project issues

 We appreciate active engagement on project discussions! Be constructive in all your interactions within communities . 

 

## **15. Security and Responsible Disclosure**

 Security vulnerabilities is important topic in all development and needs proper handling to secure our application users's sensitive sources

 Please report any potential security problems through our confidential channel: email [ security.team@example.com]. Refraim publicly revealing issues or vulnerability details as public discussion expose the system risk

 Responsible vulnerability report and fast response helps help maintain and ensure system's security from malicious attackers who could take system. Please reach team for assistance.

 

## **16. Release Process**

 When changes is finalized new stable product or versions need released with a set procedure that is standardized by team

 We release tags on git that indicates specific code state . Changelog is auto genereated to list feature change or updates made.

 After releases and version, product deployment occurs with automated steps that will ensure seamless experience for new user adoption

 

## **17. Recognition**

We believe it critical that contributors receive appropriate acknowledge or crediting to boost project's momentum to attract more users

 A list maintain contributor can be view at file on  project `README`. Also a CHANGELOG is update for all new commits related contribution to be listed

 Project maintain will provide a badges and mention for those active members who help make community lively and vibrant by supporting others in project 

 

## **18. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**

 If contributing substantial portions codebase it'd needed legal documents known CLAs to protect legal aspects from potential legal liabilities . Please see our full license agreement to be compliant and avoid any potential risk for our legal protection
