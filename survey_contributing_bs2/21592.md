# contributing.md

## Introduction

This repository is thriving because of contributions from a community of developers, thinkers, and enthusiasts! This document provides guidelines for anyone hoping to assist in its development.

Contributions, regardless of their size, directly contribute to the success and continued evolution of this project. Every bug fix, documentation improvement, code change, or suggestion has a lasting, positive impact.

We encourage contributors of all skill levels to become a part of our collaborative project. Even suggesting a change without directly contributing code is an incredibly helpful act. Please read through the guidelines below to understand how you can get involved and maximize your effectiveness while ensuring that our standards are followed. 

## Code of Conduct

Please understand that all collaborators, maintainers, and users must behave respectfully toward each another. In this inclusive and open collaborative environment, we encourage open and thoughtful discussions while maintaining a safe and respectful experience for everyone.

We expect everyone to communicate professionally and to avoid language or behavior which is offensive in nature. Any behavior considered disrespectful, discriminatory, or disruptive is not welcome here.

Violation of the Code of Conduct will result in action, including warnings, requests to reconsider behavior, removal from the discussion channels or, if necessary, a ban from the project.  We believe fostering a positive and collaborative community benefits all involved

## Getting Started

To contribute you need to setup your development environment. First, clone and obtain the repository from its GitHub source by using: git clone <repository link>.

Next, you would need to configure Node, Yarn, and other environment-specific dependencies according to requirements listed in the README or INSTALL instructions, if available.  This may entail the installation using your OS's native package management or by installing the software using their respective methods.   

After installation, initialize a new local branch:  `git checkout -b feature/your-contribution`. This keeps the main working branch clean with stable code. This branching practice allows for focused work while preventing disruptions to stable versions.

Build your local environment. The command to build is often found in the root or a documentation file in the source directory of the repository: `npm run build`. Ensure you' re using the proper commands to set up the environment to avoid unexpected behaviors or failures when testing your work before contributing.

Once you' ve built your environment you can begin making local commits to your branch.

## How to Contribute

Numerous ways to contribute exist to assist this project.  The most common involve code fixes, feature enhancements or documenting the code for other contributors. All help is appreciated and considered vital to growth in our community effort.

You can report issues encountered, suggest features to expand project capability, send contributions such as a patch or pull request with code fixes, or contribute by improving the documentation itself. The more people contribute, the better our code can reach its full capacity of performance!

Before implementing major changes, we highly encourage you to engage in a discussion with the maintain team through a new GitHub issue to ensure your proposal lines up with our long- term roadmap and to receive any necessary feedback.  

Remember even minor corrections, documentation changes & issue clarifications make a significant difference!  Every contribution helps shape an improved user-friendly software! We are all thankful for every contribution!

## Reporting Bugs

When a bug is encountered, report it to ensure quick correction or workaround creation. To ensure that maintain contributors are able to assist as quickly as possible:  describe the issue and how it was encountered. Be detailed!

Include a clear and concise description detailing the exact behavior you' ve encountered when you expected a certain outcome. Include the exact steps you took, what you tried to do, what you actually experienced, what error message appeared, your environment setup, and related information that could aid maintain contributors' understanding.

Providing a reproducible example greatly simplifies the debugging process. A simplified test case allows others to easily replicate the problem in their own environments which makes troubleshooting far less difficult.. Submit any discovered problems by opening a new issue, and be descriptive when describing it.

## Suggesting Enhancements

If you have ideas for new features or project improvements, please bring them to the table.  Clearly state what the intended use case is to help maintain contributors to determine the usefulness of your proposal in our overall strategy goals.

Describe the feature in enough detail such that the maintainer team can understand the problem you are solving, the expected user behavior, and why it is worthwhile to implement. Include any potential alternatives or considerations that should be taken.

Maintain contributors will carefully evaluate suggestions based on scope and impact, aligning to existing project goals, feasibility, resources. Prioritization may also be influenced through community interest and alignment. 

## Pull Request Process

To submit a proposed contribution, create a branch from your fork. Branch names such as: `feature/new-feature` or `fix/issue #123`. Commit your code using clear, concise messages following established coding standards (explained later)

After your code is committed push your local branch to your for fork and then submit a pull request to the main repository.  The pull request should have a descriptive title and a clear description including all related information that could aid maintain reviewer contributions.  

The team will review and test your pull request, and might request additional clarifications or changes. Address and push any requested revisions as necessary. A passing CI and a thorough reviewer sign-off are required for merging. Once merged the contribution is considered accepted. 

## Coding Standards

To ensure a consistent code base, adhere strictly to a set of established coding principles. We follow a set of established conventions, so all code contributes to a clean and uniform codebase that promotes understanding and collaboration.

Use an indentation of 2 spaces for all Python code, and ensure that code blocks are consistent in their structure and organization. Use the standard Python naming conventions: lowercase for variable/ function names and capitalized for module names to aid code readability and comprehension.

Our linter is configured at the repository and will flag code that does not meet the established guidelines which must be resolved.  This can be configured by following the documentation provided within this repository.

## Testing Guidelines

Testing helps ensure stability. It is required that all contributions are accompanied by new or modified tests demonstrating correct operation. This guarantees code works as intended. 

We primarily focus on utilizing unit tests for individual components, integration tests for validating components interaction with their dependencies , and regression tests for ensuring no existing functionality has been compromised by new code. The repository contains the testing framework that must be adhered to during contribution.

All new features, bug fixes or modifications require a test to prove functionality, and should be included. Ensure the build passes before the contribution is considered accepted. 

## Documentation Contributions

High quality documentation is an important part of a project. It is expected that all contributed features or code should be properly and concisely documented for future use cases.

Documentation files live in the `docs` directory, and follow Markdown standards for consistent and easy to use formatting. When you make contributions, update or add appropriate documentation to clarify and describe code usage and features to aid in comprehension and use.

Make sure you test your modifications by running the build to see if it can correctly render documentation to guarantee proper and consistent output across environments.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Commit messages provide important historical tracking for code changes. They allow contributors to better understand the reasoning and evolution behind each change which allows for future code improvement and comprehension. 

Each commit should be concise and describe the change in detail. A recommended style is: " `type(scope): subject` where `type` is one of ` feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, or `chore` and scope specifies the component or module affected. 

Consistent commit format aids maintainers with easier navigation, automated changelog generations and project versioning, contributing toward the organization and maintenance efforts.

 ## Branching Model

We use a Git Flow variant for our branching model. `main` serves as the stable, production-ready branch. `develop`, serves as a integration of ongoing development. All feature or fix work should start from your personal fork.

New contributors should always base new feature branches or bug-fix branches off of the current `main` branch to minimize the risks of conflicts or merge-related issues during contributions or updates.

When finished a pull request to the `develop` branch is requested before being merged into a production `main ` branch. 

## Review Process

All proposed contributions are carefully reviewed by a maintain. It is expected that you will provide prompt and professional responses to any reviewer comments or suggestions.

During review contributors can expect constructive feedback related to design or functionality of proposed changes. Be prepared to iterate on your code and to engage respectfully in dialogue regarding the proposal. Once approved, maintain will merge the contribution. 

 ## Communication Channels

Communication is crucial for collaborative efforts. For general discussions, bug reports, and feature requests, GitHub issues are the primary communication channel. 

For quick, informal discussions, consider joining our Slack channel ([link to Slack](example.com/slack)).  For more technical questions or help, feel free use our online forum ([link to forum](example.com/forum)). 

## Security and Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a potential security vulnerability, *do not* publicly disclose it.  Instead, contact the maintainers directly and privately. 

Send an email to [security@example.com](mailto security@example.com). Provide as much technical detail as possible, including the steps to reproduce and any affected versions or platforms. 

## Release Process

New versions are released periodically. Tag new versions using semantic versioning (`major. minor. patch`) to denote the type and magnitude of changes.

The changelog is updated with a summary of the changes, bug fixes, and feature additions in each release. Finally, a deployment script is triggered to publish the build. 

## Recognition 

We deeply acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of our contributors! Every contribution is listed within the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file within this repo and will be credited in the release notes for all releases.

We also display a badge on the project’s README file acknowledging contributors. We are extremely grateful for your efforts!
