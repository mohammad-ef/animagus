# CONTRIBUTING#
  
 Welcome! We are glad about your willingness to contribute to this project, making it robust and feature-rich with a great experience to all of our end-users and developers alike. All contributions are greatly encouraged and will be evaluated carefully. We aim for a welcoming, supportive community for all.

  We believe that everyone can contribute, regardless of your coding experience. Contributions are not solely about code - improving documentation, writing tutorials, providing feedback, or helping maintain community resources are incredibly valuable. Your involvement is vital as we build a thriving environment to foster innovation.

  This guide details our guidelines and provides a standardized workflow for contributors. By submitting pull requests, you confirm you' ve reviewed this guide, that you agree with our standards, and will act respectfully toward other contributors. Please read it thoroughly before submitting any contribution.
 
## 1. Code of Conduct

 We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community. All participants are expected to treat each other with respect and kindness, regardless of differences in experience, expertise, or identity. We strive to foster a collaborative and supportive environment to allow everyone to feel safe and respected. 

 Bullying, harassment, or any form of discrimination will not be tolerated. We expect all contributors to be open-minded and respectful of differing opinions and perspectives. If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact a maintainer immediately.

 Any violations of this Code of Conduct, will result in warnings, temporary suspensions, or, in severe cases, permanent bans from the project. We are determined to maintain a positive atmosphere that promotes innovation and learning in a welcoming environment.

## 2. Getting Started

   To get started, fork the repository on GitHub, then create a new branch from `main` for your changes.  Using a descriptive branch name ( e.g. `fix/typo-in-readme`, `feature/new-login`) will make reviewing your changes easier for everyone. Avoid direct commits to the `main` branch and always use a branch to manage your contributions.

   First and foremost, you will need to install the project dependencies to run it locally. This project uses `pip` for dependency installation. Clone the repository to your local system. Then navigate into your downloaded local directory, and execute the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   The build process is relatively simple, you'll likely not need to change it, however for some contributions the execution and testing may require you to first compile any related components with something like `make`. Make sure to consult `README.md` as there could be some platform specific setup. After that run `python main.py` or any similar start up sequence.

   To test this, make sure the project has a suite of testing in the `./tests` folder, execute: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test*.py"` This suite covers various aspects; however it does **not** test for any potential regressions introduced through code, so be cautious and make small commits. 

   We suggest setting up Git Hooks using tools such as `pre-commit` for formatting the commit code, this tool helps with formatting consistency before committing any files into Git, ensuring that we adhere to code styling best practices to make reviewing contributions faster. This tool requires an install using `pip install pre-commit`, then `pre-commit install`.

## 3. How to Contribute

 We encourage all developers to contribute by providing bug reports, suggestions, documentation enhancements, code modifications and new feature implementation as needed! Feel free to reach out on Github issues and create your tickets for us to review and provide a quick turnaround, to keep our product in good working order.

  Submitting high-quality, detailed bug reports saves significant development time and allows us to respond swiftly. Similarly, suggestions of innovative improvements and valuable new functionalities contribute significantly towards improving user-satisfaction with our project! Don`t underestimate documentation and code reviews.

 We encourage that contributors open new GitHub issues if they'd like to propose any large architectural or implementation changes to discuss with the development team! Doing so helps prevent work in duplicate efforts and ensures your ideas have an increased probability of implementation with a design-aligned flow.

 Improving the quality of the documentation ensures all future developers or end-users alike, have ease-of-access with the current version! Clear concise instructions with diagrams helps ensure new comers can quickly learn the basics of what's being worked on or implemented and how that translates. 

   Before starting on a major feature, discussing your approach is beneficial to the whole development team to help maintain design principles! You can reach us via a comment in an existing open GitHub issue and/or you can create a brand new issue for the proposal.
  

## 4. Reporting Bugs

  We value detailed bug reports as these assist with identifying defects with high precision for the relevant development resources, and also improves future code quality in general by providing additional edge case test cases for our tests suite. When reporting any defect make sure all steps taken that caused such bug have been outlined.

 If possible, a simple yet concise minimal, reproducible example, often described as Minimal Working Example is a critical element of a good bug report, it is what enables quick validation and allows us to pinpoint and quickly correct the issue. This example is a self-contained program or set of actions that consistently reproduce the issue.

 The most recommended channel to communicate these findings, as previously discussed, are by submitting an issue on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT/issues). The more details provided within, such as environment information and stack traces are the best.

 We appreciate a succinct subject with details like the observed unexpected results versus what's was supposed to have been expected to help us understand the nature of a reported bug and what we can anticipate when trying to solve them for the end-user experience.

  The team aims to respond quickly on bug fixes; please refrain from submitting duplicate bug reports; before opening new ones make sure a similar report already has not been submitted! If a relevant one has been identified then please post it under its current existing post and we can aggregate and address appropriately. 

## 5. Suggesting Enhancements

 Proposing feature improvements are highly valuable in ensuring project evolution in keeping current market demands in a rapidly expanding landscape; new feature implementations can significantly benefit both our end-users and developer teams involved. To effectively suggest an enhancement please describe how you came across it as a necessity to the current state or workflow.

 To provide a more detailed picture for review teams we ask the contribution requests have motivation for why this enhancement matters; this should outline any specific issues the project would address. This helps in better prioritizes based on user-centric needs, market analysis or a potential ROI from a technical aspect.

 When you submit these ideas on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT/issues) provide some use cases that demonstrate the value and practicality for potential adopters in our target-demographic; a quick mock-up would do great, as showing an implementation idea would go great!

 Review of feature enhancement will take some time, depending on resources availability; we appreciate understanding and the importance to wait for our evaluation before jumping to a direct implement; we want everyone's input considered.

 The development team prioritizes feature requests, balancing development workload with alignment to product vision & goals and available time; please refrain from sending aggressive reminders about status. This helps in making objective prioritization based solely on value delivered!

## 6. Pull Request Process

 To begin with make sure the latest state of code has been incorporated to you're fork via using `git fetch` or using GitHub's pull function on our website to get our code updated into your repository if there was new modifications that need your consideration before contributing further on it! This will keep your branch up to date!

 Before you submit you branch with any potential fixes please name it in an organized, and easy way such as feature/{your-branchname}, where you describe your changes! This ensures consistency within all contributors and allows reviewers the easiest to comprehend quickly with what changes have been submitted and how! Then you checkout into it via: `git checkout -b feature/your-branchname`.

 Once ready, commit changes, pushing your new changes onto a feature branch to our Github, then submit that change for a review. The submission includes creating pull requests on GitHub from that created forked feature. Please provide descriptive names, with clear and informative explanation. This assists our reviewing processes for easier evaluation.

 We review PRs carefully; feedback and discussions happen within PR and are a collaborative way, where suggestions will come with a detailed breakdown, with clear explanation. Address them, making revisions where applicable until reviewers have confirmed it satisfies their needs; it`s important that everyone has consensus for integration purposes. 

 The pull request is automatically merged and pushed into `main`, and we appreciate your effort! Following merge your work can become visible and used in all functionality by end-users. 

## 7. Coding Standards

 This repository adheres to Python `PEP 8` where we aim for clear readability. This encompasses code structure such as consistent spacing, and formatting with indentation to increase clarity! This helps make the entire project readable with the least possible cognitive effort when reviewing code changes.

 To maintain a standard format of Python style code, we encourage linting and checking to identify issues such as code styling errors that might not adhere fully to coding style guides; using tools such as `flake8` helps catch issues with style or potential errors with coding standards. 

 Type checking can catch bugs where incorrect assumptions can be flagged early in development cycles, this prevents unexpected crashes! Use `mypy` for the implementation!  Document code clearly! Docstrings for function should be concise and provide enough to explain parameter details, what they return as a general expectation with the function call.

 A config is included in our project for automatic linting, formatting to keep consistent coding practices within all commits for better overall readability in future development, so ensure to check these configs. 

 This standard of coding is to promote maintainability and collaborative workflows to reduce any future issues arising!  Please follow them diligently to reduce friction within development cycle and to keep things consistent.

## 8. Testing Guidelines

  All contributions and maintainers alike have a shared duty and responsiblity of maintaining and ensuring quality with tests to ensure all code is properly vetted; to keep this process going, make sure there's proper unit and testing for any modifications. Run our existing suite with: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test*.py"`. 

   To help improve quality testing is included in builds; all contributions and maintainers must run this prior committing to ensure code doesn not cause unintended failures or regressions; if any tests get fail please make adjustments to the relevant test to address the issue. 

   If you have created modifications in your feature and need to include the necessary test cases please create the test file and add a unit to that file; these need to include test scenarios where all possible inputs and conditions have been checked. We use Python standard `unittest` to perform tests for code functionality.

 We also encourage you implement end to end and/or regression test cases for ensuring changes doesn cause problems across entire project to avoid any regressions in existing behavior or functions. Please follow best test implementation to keep our test suite clean, well-maintained and functional with clear explanations to each individual.

  Make it easier on us as reviewing working through your PR; by including detailed paperwork on testing to demonstrate that you took all the necessary considerations with quality. 

## 9. Documentation Contributions

  The `docs` directory within this repository hosts most project-relevant documentations that are critical with keeping our end-users well equipped to handle their own use-cases without relying so much with outside sources to find an immediate answer to any problem.  This directory can include but not limited to quick tutorials to in-depth reference documentation and more. 

 Ensure to update this whenever a feature has changes implemented or bug reports that impact the documentation, otherwise our users end up with misleading information with incorrect implementations of a project or its use. It may cause issues, with a frustrating experience that impacts their ability to get their goals met with what the system promises. 

  We adhere strict style guidelines to improve clarity. Ensure the language and phrasing of your contributions have consistency, and use a style and voice consistent to that currently implemented across all our existing files, with simple clear explanation for anyone who may have difficulty to read technical documents and guides. 

 Consistency across language usage helps improve understanding with users that are from all walks of life with their diverse understanding and skill. Ensure that formatting and style adhere with documentation standards as we follow.  We also recommend using a spell check! 

 The team aims to maintain and respond swiftly on the requests. So be mindful when making any changes that impact end users and/or development teams involved; be prepared to answer or engage in further feedback as needed with what needs improvements to keep everyone satisfied!

## 10. Commit Message Guidelines

 Consistent formatting and information contained within our git log history provides invaluable details on our change management and overall progress with the project to track our development cycle! We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as this ensures consistency of changes made throughout. 

 Use prefixes for your changes that indicate intent with your contribution: for `feat` for new feature, `fix` for correcting bugs/error and `docs` indicating that there is only updates within documents/tutorials/readme! Be descriptive with a concise sentence with explanation and what change does in the code; don `t assume anyone has prior knowledged and be verbose! 

 We require to be specific on describing any code related details and changes to prevent ambiguities when looking into logs or histories for troubleshooting any potential defects. Be as concise yet thorough to have others understanding with changes being introduced without needing a long detailed review and understanding process! 

 We want a standardized history, which makes debugging and understanding change flow far faster, and makes it easier on maintainers! Commit history provides important insight on project progression to understand delays. We are not just writing for other code users but we `re writing history as we build, as this information will last long beyond what code may become.

 We also ask to be clear that all messages should use `Imperative Present Tehran:`, such as "Add a button to change background color." It helps convey a directive action in an action and makes for clear context on the action. This makes commit logs much better!

## 11. Branching Model

 This entire team currently adheres the "Gitflow workflow."  The overall approach consists in the branching from our stable main, or stable and well maintained development for ongoing improvements in functionality for end-users, as that allows developers with a degree of protection and independence!

 For the creation of a feature/bug, always checkout the stable development or latest release branch before proceeding, and always use the descriptive feature branches like: feature/user-login-page to avoid naming conflicts; that makes collaboration with everyone a bit more streamlined for a cohesive flow and easy management.

 Once your contribution branch reaches maturity (i.e, all changes reviewed & implemented, fully testing with passing code) we will then merge the branch in with develop/release branches depending upon where we think is needed, for integration. 
 Always keep an open communication with maintainers for approval or suggestions before pushing the release into a higher stage to ensure all aspects work seamlessly together for a cohesive flow, to make integration easy with less errors

 When it reaches a state with enough changes and feature maturity then will merge from Develop and release as the official version into production using main for long term support for end users who use and benefit! 

## 12. Review Process

 Pull request is created, reviewers are designated on that to provide a critical overview on your work with code quality as part of overall standards. They provide detailed reviews to improve readability as it makes debugging incident a far smoother and easier flow than previously had. 

 All reviews should happen within our project Github repository by posting in-line code-suggestions or asking clarifications. We will provide clear explanation, reasoning for changes or requests with what the expectation to achieve the overall goals. Please engage, ask for more clarification. Don 't be scared or hesitate.

 Response to the reviews are to have all the feedback implemented, with changes documented or a clear and detailed reason with explanation to the reviewer as for why certain requests have not been implemented for better communication of this team and understanding! We appreciate and value transparency and communication to achieve desired quality with code and workflow. 

 A merged pull request represents final validation with code approval with passing requirements for integration within project's development. All PR merges should follow with an updated `Changelog` entry as it documents our change histories that are essential when debugging.

## 13. Communication Channels

 For discussions around any bugs reported issues we use Github's internal issue tracker and we also recommend using Github `discussions`. It`s available for non urgent matters, feature enhancement request that are open discussion. Please use those!

 The best channel and place to contact the development and maintaining team is directly using comments within open or closed bug reports or feature proposals; all the comments within are visible within all users for transparency with a history! This helps transparency within project and helps all understand with any discussions! 

 We aim to keep communication and engagement in public for maximum visibility of the development cycle for end-users, maintainer transparency to keep them aware with project status! It fosters trust as all users and members have a sense that we value open discussions and collaborative workflows! 
 For private issues and concerns reach us by DM on the team GitHub page and we can resolve in a much safer environment with all privacy. Please respect that as a private environment to prevent public compromisations with information that we deem not to share.

## 14. Security and Responsible Disclosure

  We deeply encourage contributors and external developers who identify any vulnerability within code implementation, that is potentially dangerous for our platform! If that has the possibility for harmful exploitation please reach us via private channel with email to the project contact.
 Don not make the information of a detected security issues known or made visible on our GitHub or any publicly facing platform until proper action can happen; only do the reveal with our approval after mitigation! It protects both the team from liability. 

 Security and data of users is top priorities, so the responsible handling to prevent potential damage for exploitation and misuse are automated with automated testing! If it`s a serious case it needs our team attention, a private discussion on resolution of such security vulnerabilities!

 Responsible Disclosure helps prevent damage by ensuring proper remediation is available; by doing such it keeps end users data in a better position!  The earlier we are alerted of vulnerabilities allows the quicker resolution and mitigations that prevents harm to project data with data protection in general!

## 15. Release Process

 To keep high consistency with product versions for all stakeholders in our environment all release versions go into semantic versions that describes change levels! For a version, we indicate a number, `X.Y.Z`, represented where we maintain our code quality, functionality or breaking features. 

 Before any release we first prepare with all testing of modifications implemented for our next upcoming build version, this involves automated build tests for regression, functional checks of implemented feature sets; with a quality check by maintaining and senior engineering teams.

 Tag our version within main, then bump version in the configuration with new values that indicates our versioning with `major`.major.minor` version for all the users; that helps everyone identify our versions easily, to know whether to upgrade with latest features to their existing implementation of our code and infrastructure! This will make the integration of changes smoother for future developers or stakeholders! 

 Deployment to a release version happens with fully automation with p
