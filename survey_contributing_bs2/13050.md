 ## 1: Code & Conduct

We strive to build a community around mutual respect for all contributors as an integral element for creating high-quality, innovative solutions together with our users and partners alike. Every voice is valued here, so it' is essential for all participants involved in this process that they respect, appreciate and support others involved and ensure everyone feels comfortable and safe in a shared workspace.

We're building a community based on respect, professionalism, empathy, open communication, and a welcoming attitude toward all who contribute or are part of our wider circle of users and advocates. This encompasses treating others kindly, being considerate of others viewpoints when providing constructive criticism, and being mindful that everyone may be at vastly dissimilar skill levels.

Harassment, threats, abusive or discriminatory behaviour are not tolerated in this collaborative space. Violating code-conduct guidelines will unfortunately trigger a series of consequences, which may include temporary or indefinite restriction to this project or even potential legal action. We want all to contribute safely, so it is critical all parties follow guidelines set forth.

## 2:  Getting Started

First, ensure your environment includes Git, a command line interface, and necessary dependencies, such as Node.js for our JavaScript build, or Python 3 with relevant library packages to compile your source.  The installation instructions for these items can be easily found via their corresponding websites or documentation channels to get started.

To begin, clone our repository with the simple `git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/your-repo. git` instruction and move into the directory using `cd your-repo`. Then run the setup instructions for any project configuration and dependency installation with a single and simple step: `npm install` (or similar, like `pip install -r requirements.txt`) to prepare and launch our system locally!

It would be ideal if we followed a feature branch-workflow, meaning that whenever creating your code and implementing features to submit a new code contribution you should make a branch based off of our current `main` using: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` command that ensures the code contributions remain isolated and easily reviewable as needed! Remember it helps ensure your edits stay distinct, allowing focused code analysis for all to see clearly as a single change and to maintain our project structure as intended to function smoothly!

Create an environment file (eg., `.env.dev`) by copy & paste contents found in example folders like .env.example to manage our API and security secrets locally! Make these values safe with the knowledge it can prevent sensitive code to ever reach a wider stage. This is also where your personal settings, such as development server settings are configured to your individual preferences!

Finally, build and test to get a preview using a standard compilation or building procedure: For javascript `npm run build`.  If it successfully builds and any associated error checks are resolved it indicates the environment configuration has properly loaded! 	If errors persist ensure the local installation steps completed appropriately or contact us on channels to discuss!

## 3: How to Contribute

Here are numerous methods of how you may want to assist the overall improvement and growth! Bug reports and suggestions offer vital data points for development; however the primary contribution method remains through submitting a PR to improve upon an already present feature. 

Don`t forget about documentation and testing, both integral for any great software and we would appreciate any effort spent there; however if code isn't within your skillset it does not disqualify a person for providing help with those two areas. Even fixing small spelling/grammatical/style mistakes can be invaluable for creating clarity, and consistency and improving our usability to others and ourselves for future use.

Before beginning significant code implementations it will significantly aid to raise awareness of a possible feature and solicit feedback to ensure the change reflects our goals while not impacting existing workflows, thus, feel free to discuss it beforehand! Communication and collaboration helps align efforts!  It avoids unnecessary re-work if you find others were thinking on the same path, and ensures your contribution aligns within project direction.

Consider also, contributing via code refactoring and optimization can dramatically help with long-term scalability and stability as it ensures we stay modern for years. It improves performance as new hardware becomes widely adopted as the underlying system evolves alongside the ever changing digital frontier for all. 

Lastly it helps to contribute feedback, especially about usability! Providing insight helps improve accessibility, which allows us cater for a wider array of audiences! This also creates positive impacts and ensures a great product!  This also makes it easier for us to maintain our standards while growing with all contributors!

## 4: Reporting Bugs

Whenever an error appears it is best that you take action! The bug needs thorough investigation by first isolating the source so as that other members may replicate, thus providing insight towards resolving issues. 

Please submit clear reports detailing exact actions required in creating it and what you actually see versus expected! It can be extremely useful by creating short test files and steps in your local machine to showcase what is failing for all to observe! Providing a small minimal and runnable sample that exhibits an error greatly accelerates debugging processes and saves us countless valuable hours as well.

Submit a report using our Github "Issues" area under project labels such as, e.g. "bug." When doing this please offer the system information as that also aids with diagnosing. This information includes the Operating System being utilized (ie: windows), version (e.g.: Windows 10 version 22H2) alongside versions, of all packages involved as a means of reproduction (for debugging purposes), along with relevant logs to ensure proper investigation to solve and prevent in the future!

Please remember more information helps greatly and reduces back-and-forth conversations for quick and efficient issue closure.

## 5: Suggesting Enhancements

Proposing an update requires the explanation to what circumstance or situation prompted your suggestion for improvements! We value the ability to explain and share use-cases so all may comprehend the intended outcome and potential for growth. We appreciate a description that outlines benefits clearly as the goal to increase project quality for users is what we prioritize here.

The maintainers of the system review feature requests to see whether there will benefit users during usage! The team assesses factors to help make this call as well which involve effort and potential scope impact as part of prioritization, balancing short term vs long term gains as part of an evaluation! This includes evaluating if there will require substantial modifications as well.

We welcome feature suggestions and discussions within dedicated channels like the Discord or Slack communities or by starting discussions through "Github" "Issues." This enables open communication so others are in a similar state. 

Prioritized changes may eventually be planned into our upcoming project releases!  Your contribution can shape our future! This allows a roadmap, and a direction towards what our next development goals entail which will ultimately benefit our overall community to help drive the overall vision for future endeavors and innovations together as collaborators!

---

## 6: Pull Request Process

Fork our code to get ready to begin working locally to prepare a new Pull Request (PR).  Create a dedicated branch named appropriately such as feature/featuretitle (for features) and bugfix/bugtitlename (for any error resolution!)
 
Then create an updated Pull Request to send your branch changes back! Please include the PR Title as an overview that is a single sentence of purpose so we easily discern your intentions when reading. Also, ensure the Pull Request template has all pertinent info like issue # or link, motivation for update & screenshots or demonstrations for a clearer review of work involved to ensure all individuals are fully aware,

The maintenance crew carefully reviews the PR. It is essential they check code to ensure that style guides & testing procedures match! The changes should be tested as per guidelines. If any adjustments must happen it may request revisions and/or changes! If not then the code will get accepted! It's all about ensuring code consistency across projects as that improves quality over the course!

Once approved and successfully merging a successful branch, code gets included! Then it becomes officially apart from codebase with its changes and becomes an official component within project scope moving toward its overall goal with a wider community impact,

## 7: Coding Standards

Code quality remains essential as part for project health; consistency, reliability is our top goal. We expect clean coding style as well that aligns and meets project conventions, so all users can benefit and maintainability becomes more accessible to future updates as the landscape shifts, 

The style guide is enforced through linters like `eslint` configured within our `.eslintrc.js` (for javascript). Ensure to resolve and follow these suggestions to improve overall clarity & avoid conflicts, while maintaining consistency with other parts as that ensures our code is easily readable as part our community,

Ensure type checks using the built-in tools like `TSlint` and/or similar that will check for correct types for variables/arguments as that helps catch type based error conditions before the runtime! It prevents issues that may surface as part code deployment as an unexpected behavior!

Document your work as if future engineers need read & follow as an instruction. It must provide a comprehensive insight into functionality and intent and provide clarity.

---

## 8: Testing Guidelines

All new code submissions are subject review. The existing and newly developed test suites run and produce expected results and are crucial and should ensure stability for the product, and provide confidence to all. Please add relevant code! 

We rely upon Jest as primary unit and integrations testing. Please follow the conventions to set up tests in your local project!  Test all changes and additions and include any test edge cases that might not have originally surfaced and could cause errors down stream to catch and resolve issues preemptively!

Strive toward covering both basic and edge cases. Unit testing should test each unit and function; the testing should focus primarily and test only on the individual functions! Integration Testing must test multiple parts working and is crucial so as components function cohesively to produce output that's intended for all users as that drives our mission of success. Regression testing helps identify if the recent changes have inadvertently broke old or previous functioning areas, and we highly recommend those tests as a crucial safety step during release

---

## 9: Documentation Contributions

To keep documentation clear concise and easy-to-use for others and ourselves as the community we value clear concise & accurate instructions for others. We have markdown formatted README, CONTRIBUTING guides for ease of maintenance as that helps ensure everyone remains well oriented with overall standards

Updates to documents and guides happen in project folder. Please review for accuracy. Please keep language professional! Also be clear about instructions. Use diagrams or illustrations to aid clarity as those provide more understanding than text can offer as those should aim towards ease-to-use

---

## 10: Commit Message Guidelines

Each and every one commits need be succinct & well formatted for future references so the code base remains clean & traceable for debugging! Follow the structure in "conventional commits"! For the project `Conventional Commits` style should always apply. `fix:(something), feat:(feature)`, as that ensures consistency as that helps others discern changes with greater understanding & efficiency.

Prefix each of the descriptions in commits by indicating their scope (such as feat or build). A clear explanation as a succinct and understandable reason why a commit took place as an instruction. A short sentence of no more then `72-characters`.  These rules promote readability across entire project! 

The project team benefits significantly and it becomes an important tool in managing project versions for our future deployments

---

## 11: Branching Model

For simplicity's sake of our overall codebase the Gitflow branching will become standard and expected across contributors, for consistency & organization. Main serves a stable baseline and development represents working space as all features and improvements occur there. It's critical not committing or creating changes on this as those must always come via the dev.

Feature Branches are spun when starting any development or new functionality from Dev for an easier tracking process that helps with review/testing. Once the work finishes and it becomes stable, you then merge into Development as its part final approval and inclusion

We utilize a naming convention that's feature/{shortfeatureName}, bugfix/{bugTitle}.  Clear organization promotes ease to follow changes & helps everyone know exactly the branch origin. It is recommended all follow to ease maintenance & improve project quality as we work collectively together for future endeavors & improvements as we move on toward future goals together!

---

## 12: Review Process

Upon PR submitions we perform an exhaustive examination as the first phase that looks and validates compliance for guidelines, style checks to prevent code degradation as the project expands to maintain code standards! It then follows by the technical aspects and correctness as well as ensuring no side effect occur during changes. 

Expect detailed & thoughtful suggestions & reviews that can require revisions and clarifications before the changes may become included and approved for integration within project code and workflow library and overall structure. We encourage discussions, feedback for improvement, that is what we want as that helps all of the users and community grow

We strive for a rapid turnaround but can vary with the volume, the complexities and the availability of contributors; please do allow reasonable wait periods to provide the appropriate reviews before escalations or follow ups occur and to give adequate review as it needs and deserves as a process, as well ensure to keep track on what gets implemented.

---

## 13: Communication Channels

Our main discussion hub lies through Github issues and discussions! Feel comfortable submitting bugs suggestions or asking clarification via the issues. If a more interactive and rapid discussion channel you need you could consider reaching to join on the community channels like `Discord` & or Slack

Join to chat about any ideas and share solutions for challenges and bugs in development with a more immediate real-time setting where collaboration & brainstorming can be easily exchanged for quick insights & feedback and rapid resolution

Maintain an respectful & welcoming and constructive dialogue as the best path toward positive outcomes as a united front of contributors

---

## 14: Security and Responsible Disclosure

Any vulnerability found should always come reported responsibly with no exposure and no publicity. This will allow our maintainers & teams work with you on fixing and patching any holes quickly before public exploitation as our top security goal! Contact team with direct private messaging

If any concerns or issues found it should not posted public or to any third-party channels!  Maintain a secure & respectful dialogue to avoid exposing risks or damage from any vulnerabilities to ensure our product can thrive & provide safe & enjoyable usage

Please allow adequate timeline before publishing as it is essential the security team may fix & remediate as that minimizes risks from any risky scenarios to protect our community

---

## 15: Release Process

The Release management team will take on all the release responsibilities to coordinate versions as well manage releases, with proper version numbering following semantic verison standards

Release depends greatly with contribution and code-stability as well bug fixing! We use semantic Version standards with MAJOR, MINOR & PATCH as a standard so users have expectations about features/compatibility

All new release announcements will follow proper release documentation. All contributors should adhere by following version standards so that the release is successful as the overall project goals! All changes are documented and visible for community transparency as our top priority and commitment

---

## 16: Recognition

Maintainers will list all contributors to showcase their hard works as well provide public credits to recognize efforts made! Contributors receive recognition through various badges for code quality! This encourages quality work to keep maintaining project integrity

It motivates the entire contributors as a means for encouraging community building and collaborative collaboration that helps maintain project integrity & long lasting contributions that benefits us and many more down-line along project path

We will ensure the community remains recognized! It is vital we maintain the project and acknowledgement of contributions as that ensures we remain as strong & collaborative as a group. A collective success that will continue moving forward

---

## 17: Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

The purpose as well scope is as protecting wide range and copyright of project assets to help ensure it is used appropriately by the users

To ensure legal clarity of ownership the team ask everyone submit their code via Contributor License Agreements to do their due-process for code licensing & legal clarity! We follow a process where contributors provide the proper permissions so that our work benefits us! It also prevents potential disputes

Please follow and agree for all contributors for legal framework for the overall community so everyone can move on towards our goal and work together as an organization and collective team

---

## 18: Resources and References

For a deeper exploration please see official coding standards: PEP 8 (Python). Follow those style guide standards as it provides a solid structure as part a great product for long term sustainability! Also, we reference styleguides and developer documentation so we all align on standards and can follow directions for ease!

Please check and explore all of the tools to assist as it will make life simpler and faster, which improves our process to move quickly toward goal and maintain the best code and overall smoothness in production

Engage communities as the most rewarding as this creates growth opportunities! Continuous and networked community sharing of information & support to keep improving overall project health, so please engage in discussions and feedback to enhance overall community strength
