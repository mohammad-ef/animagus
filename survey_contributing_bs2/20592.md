## Introduction

This projects is growing due the hard work, feedback of our active community and we're delighted you found us. We greatly appreciate contributions from community developers and believe open source projects benefit from many eyes and varied backgrounds. 

We encourage not only technical improvements, but also documentation, translation, accessibility enhancements and anything to make contributing easy. By helping us, you help others to use and enjoy this project too.

Let' s work towards something great together by making this the best possible version of it! Feel free to reach out, even for small things - they are all important. We are committed to being a welcoming community where everyone feels safe and supported to participate and grow as a collaborator. 

##  Code Of Conduct

We foster a welcoming and collaborative open- source environoment. As such, all interactions between contributors and participants must be polite, respectful and constructive.

We expect all participants to adhere this behavior including discussions, reviews, documentation and all project activities. Discrimination against, harassment of intimidation of any kind will not tolerated.  It includes any offensive comments. 

Violating these guidelines may result consequences which includes but is not limit removal or blocking from project communication and collaboration channels. If you notice something that doesn’t feel right reach out to a maintain and we are committed to take swift action. 

##  Getting Started

To start, you will need to have Git and a working Git environment such as the standard Git command line tools or a Git GUI client. Familiarity with a Git repository workflow like branching and pull Requests is a big plus.   

First and foremost, ensure that Node.js and npm (Node Packet Manager) are installed on the your workstation or server. You can find instructions for installing them at the respective projects web sites. Once this is set up you will have all of our dependency packages installed.

Fork the repository from your Git provider. Once you have completed that, clone it locally: `git clon <your-forked- repository>`. Next, navigate within the local repo and run `npm install`.  Finally, execute `npm start` to get everything ready and to start developing or making your contribution.    

We recommend that all new changes should take from a new branch. This allows to keep your main branch tidy. To create your new feature branch simply execute `git checkout -b feature/my-newfeature`, then start coding. 

## How to Contribute

Contributions are greatly welcome to this project!  We value contributions of all shapes, sizes, and skillsets. Whether you' re a seasoned coder or an aspiring contributor, everyone can help.

You can contribute a lot to help with this projects and we value your input in all forms and sizes. Some examples includes, bug fixes, reporting issues, suggesting new enhancements, improving our documentation and providing feedback on existing features. Don' t hesitate to start.

Before starting a large piece of work, it is recommended that you open a brief design doc or discussion issue outlining your approach. This helps to ensure that the work is aligned and prevents duplication of effort, allowing us to discuss potential issues before you spend too much time.

We are happy to accept contributions in the forms of documentation, bug fixes, feature suggestions, and other enhancements. All submissions must conform to the code standards to allow for easier integration. We appreciate all help, even small suggestions. We are a community that grows from the input of many different individuals.     

## Reporting Bugs

When you run into an error or notice a bug, please report it as thoroughly and precisely as possible. Providing as much context and information to help the team reproduce and address your issue.  

To report a bug, use this GitHub repository' s "Issues" section. When you do so, be as comprehensive with providing relevant and useful information, which may help the team to better reproduce the problem. Include steps, input, environment info and expected behaviour.   

A minimal, complete, and verifiable (MCV) example helps greatly. This means creating a concise code snippets that clearly showcases the problem. This can drastically speed up the debugging of any issues and allows us to focus our efforts. 

##  Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea that you think could be valuable to the team? Great! Let us now by opening a new enhancement suggestion. Be as specific when you describe what it is you want, how it will work, or how you think it can solve problems.

Please open a new issue with ' enhancement' prefix. Clearly define the proposed enhancement in the description, explaining its potential use cases. Consider including any design suggestions, alternative approaches.  

The team reviews all enhancements. Prioritization depends on alignment with existing goals, technical feasibility, and resources. We strive to acknowledge all suggestions promptly, and keep you abreast on their current progress. We may request clarification on your initial proposal to ensure we understand your idea and potential scope.    

## Pull Request Process

To submit changes, for a new contribution please create a new branch based off the main branch. This can be done through the following git commands: `git branch <name-your- branch>`. Then switch branches: `git checkout name-your -branch`.

Now that you have switched, make the relevant modifications, test thoroughly, and commit all the changes. Commit messages need to be detailed and clear. Use standard conventions like `feat : new implementation `. 

Before creating a PR, please ensure your code meets our requirements, like coding guidelines, test guidelines and formatting and lint requirements. Once you confirm, create the PR using the button in the top right and describe the change clearly. 

The assigned reviewer will examine the code for correctness, style, and completeness of testing. After approval, the pull request will be merged. After that a release may follow to the production version.  

## Coding Standards

We follow a style guide to maintain a consistent code base. The style guidelines are defined within the `.eslintrc.js` file. It contains all the rules, that should be followed during any development activity and it should provide a clear and uniform style throughout the project

We also make use of TypeScript. All files must be type- safe, with clear typing and no unexpected types being returned from the code. We use `eslint` and `prettier` to format all of our code. This will help maintain a consistent code base. 

## Testing Guidelines

We believe thorough testing is paramount. All new code or feature enhancements must come with corresponding unit, integration, and/or regression tests that cover all relevant functionalities. 

We use Jest as our testing framework and we expect tests to be well-written, isolated, and provide a high degree of code coverage. Tests can be run from terminal by typing `npm test`. 

It is expected to test any potential edge-cases in your code. The more you test, the more confident you can be in the code you submit. It is also expected to include any relevant test scenarios to allow for future testing.     

## Documentation Contributions

Improving documentation is always appreciated and makes a difference, even a small change. It can enhance usability and understanding and contribute greatly. If you have noticed any outdated, inaccurate, or missing documentation, feel free to update it.

The documentation lives in the same source repository, under the `/docs` or `/ documentation` folder. Use the same documentation style and language used throughout the existing documentation to allow for a seamless experience. 

Please submit changes via pull requests, just as with any other code contributions. This ensures that all contributions receive a review to maintain consistency and accuracy. We will review your changes and merge them into our official documentation once reviewed and approved.  

 ## Commit Message Guidelines

To keep our repository organized, follow a consistent and descriptive commit message conventions: Use a short, concise summary of the changes (maximum ~5 lines) to describe what change the commit makes .

Use the prefix `feat ` for new features, use `fix ` to represent fix bugs, `docs` for documenting changes, ` refactor` for improvements and so on. After the type write a concise summary of the changes. For more information check out [this link](https://www.conventionalcommits .org/en/v1 .0/#scopes), for further details.

Consistent commit formatting facilitates easier code reviews, automated changelog generations, and improves overall project comprehension for both collaborators. Clear commit messages contribute to the long-term maintainability and historical context of the code base.   

## Branching Model

We follow an enhanced Gitflow model, which helps to keep our branches tidy and organized. This model provides a structure of branching that makes it easier to manage feature development, hotfixes, or release preparation. 

The main branch should represent the production-ready state of the project. Feature branches are used for implementing new features. Fix branches are for quickly patching production defects. 

## Review Process

All pull requests will receive thorough code reviews from the core team. The team will focus on code quality, functionality, and consistency with existing style and best practices. 

Provide clear and concise feedback in the PR, and be responsive to any questions. The goal is to work together to create high-quality code and documentation. We aim to respond to pull requests within 24-48 business hours. 

## Communication Channels

If you've encountered security vulnerabilities in our project, we appreciate responsible disclosure instead of public announcement. Report the issue privately to the team. 

Please avoid disclosing the vulnerability publicly until we have had sufficient opportunity to address it. Provide detailed and actionable information related to the vulnerability. 

 ##  Release Process

After a feature is approved and merged, a new release is prepared. The team will create a new tag for the release, updating the `package.json` with the new version number using Semantic Versioning.

A changelog detailing all changes in the release is also prepared and added to the `CHANGELOG.md` file. Finally, the new tagged version is deployed to the production environment, making it available to end-users or consumers
