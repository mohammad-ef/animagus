# CONTROLS: Open Data Analytics Framework

Welcome to the open-source contribution experience for Controls, our data exploration, processing pipeline and model building tool using modern data engineering paradigms.  Our project thrives thanks to the collaborative nature of developers, domain experts, and end users, creating a community dedicated to data innovation across different industries.

We deeply appreciate any efforts you put in to improving our framework. Your insights, whether they be a new feature or an improvement in existing documentation or code quality greatly assist with our collective progress in building and improving Controls as a product. We encourage you contribute to the framework! 

We are open to diverse contributions. Beyond coding, we need support from domain experts for use case exploration, testers, writers, and individuals who can assist with documentation improvements, or even providing design ideas. Together, with everyone's assistance, Controls is a project that is built for, maintained with input, for, ultimately the community.  Let's create an awesome, accessible framework together!

## 1. Introduction

Your contributions help us enhance Controls' reliability, usability, and overall capabilities by providing valuable feedback and expertise that we can incorporate into improvements of future updates and releases of Control's core functionality. Every pull request, bug report, and documentation enhancement is highly appreciated to ensure the project maintains a high standard while growing with increasing demands.

We encourage both developers with technical coding background and domain experts, who can contribute with ideas, documentation, and testing, to get involved. The open-source model allows flexibility, where we hope all users can get involved in the community, to improve the project, to build on existing functionalities. Controls has been designed and built by people for people, and we hope the community expands! 

By collaborating with Controls and its contributors, you become more closely connected with an open-source ecosystem, enabling the collective to learn as we build a better data engineering platform together with Controls at the core of this collaborative ecosystem. Your involvement contributes directly to its vitality, helping it become even more versatile for users to build innovative analytical capabilities!

## 2. Code of Conduct

We expect all participants - contributors, maintainers, and users, to interact respectfully with one another, promoting an inclusive environment within the Controls project community. Disagreements and different approaches can naturally occur, but these should be voiced politely. Open-minded communication will assist and foster the growth of a better Controls project. 

We strictly prohibit disrespectful conduct such as discrimination, harassment, or any abusive language directed towards individuals based on their background, beliefs, identity, or expertise. This extends beyond project interactions, covering community spaces. A healthy collaboration can lead to improvements across diverse backgrounds!

Violations of this Code of Conduct will not be taken lightly. We will promptly and thoroughly investigate reported instances, taking corrective action that might include warnings, removal of participation access or a more severe consequence. If the violation persists we might take more impactful steps to resolve this violation to prevent future harm or issues!

## 3. Getting Started

To get started, first clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-org/controls.git`. Make sure to checkout a specific branch to start, or a main development version of Controls that is actively used, before starting on the project locally to avoid potential future complications that come from building from different versions. The branch structure will also dictate the direction the contribution should flow towards!

Next, navigate to the project's root directory `cd controls`. Before starting you must create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` within your environment, where all required parameters for local testing, such as connection parameters are specified, that can easily connect to your own development setup without needing direct modifications or code. This helps in isolation of the codebase from local parameters that may cause conflicts with different environments!

To install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  A virtual environment (`venv`) is *strongly* recommended before performing such actions! It's helpful and safe. Once installed run: `python -m pytest` which tests all core functionalities. The execution of `pytest` indicates you successfully have all core programs installed, allowing to contribute code changes without worrying about external environment factors.

Now that your project environment is successfully running the framework locally you should start a git repository that branches and contributes your ideas, which will later on become the framework itself through continuous integrations!  Remember, to create new commits regularly and make clear changes so it is readable when the PR request arrives, as well, for others in the team!

The project structure is relatively simple; all components and code is in `src`, all testing code and data samples are in the respective subdirectories in root directory for respective testing requirements, which allows ease for contribution in specific areas! Finally we suggest you review `docs` where you can view the architecture of our project which should aid in getting acquainted!

You can also set up development containers, which provides you ease with running our core functionalities on a single containerized image and running our tests, simplifying and ensuring consistency across contributors, which allows us a single point for integration, while providing consistency! The docker file will guide in how the main project runs, for ease and understanding on running core processes.

## 4. How to Contribute

We encourage everyone to report bugs they encounter and feature ideas. Reporting issues with descriptive reproduction cases allows maintainers to reproduce problems easily to solve bugs faster.  Suggesting feature improvements allows the project evolve, which provides improvement over current framework capabilities and provides new opportunities in our current workflow!

Contributing pull requests, especially after careful consideration to coding style and conventions. The contribution of Pull Requests provides the community access and opportunity to build over changes in functionality or fix potential code flaws that could cause issues. Before submitting any major refactor of code please start a discussion in GitHub's Issue Section for review before implementation.

Submitting well-documented contributions to improving existing docs allows contribution across non-development users of Controls and can help to increase access for a wider demographic. Documentation updates should maintain clear writing conventions and should align closely with how core components interact, to reduce misunderstandings or issues for new or inexperienced developers! 

Let us encourage a community approach to contribute with each step in a continuous process that ensures high standard. We are excited to receive Pull Requests to build and develop a stronger version of Control.  Your feedback and participation contribute toward our collective development goals for a larger Controls platform, for everyone to build from and use with ease!

## 5. Reporting Bugs

When encountering a bug, the best method to communicate your finding is by opening a new issue on the project. This will notify the maintainers. Be clear on details when providing information.

The title should clearly state the error in the framework that needs fixing to allow easier triage of issues from maintainers to quickly solve the reported flaw. A comprehensive error log is essential that allows to easily trace issues in debugging processes as the information will aid significantly with fixing! Include detailed reproduction steps. This is crucial as this will provide the information on the issue's cause as it helps with reproduction for quick testing to allow for easier bug solving.

Please also specify which environment/version is being used. Providing environment parameters (operating system, library downloads size and other dependencies) and framework's versions allow for more targeted reproduction to help get the root causes!  The more detail and specificity the more effective it is for developers solving issues regarding bug finding. 

## 6. Suggesting Enhancements

New feature requests are extremely welcome in our Controls Framework and help us improve our framework with ideas to build better tools in a more robust environment. When opening an issue on our Issue's Tracker provide your reasoning behind it with use case documentation and expected behaviors in the new feature addition.

Clearly articulate why you're proposing a new feature or improvement with real-world applications or concrete use cases in different areas or scenarios where the addition or update could prove useful for different types of developers to improve efficiency in the current system! A small proof of concept can assist greatly.

Keep in mind the review is a priority list that is managed and updated on a routine and maintainers need the framework to evolve at reasonable speed. The suggestions routes through our internal priority list. We review these on routine bases so maintain consistency and to prevent delays.

## 7. Pull Request Process

To initiate a change or feature add create a new branch starting from either `main` or `develop` with clear branching structure. A suggested pattern includes prefixes such as `feature/`, `fix/` so that changes flow in correct fashion!  Use the `git checkout -b feature/my-feature` or `git checkout -b fix/important-fix` for clarity of branch names, to aid and assist developers for clear aspects when reading!

Make changes and add descriptive commit messages. The more descriptive you add on top, it allows other reviewers in assessing whether the contribution adds value and if any information that can be further elaborated upon needs clarification, which will improve readability. After committing, push to your local. 

Then you need to make a pull request, which proposes the integration and merging your contribution. Clearly summarize what your change entails on top of a Pull Request description to allow ease on what the change brings, what is expected, to provide rationale to the overall merge. Be open to code review! This can include multiple reviews before being considered for integration to ensure quality standards!

After your Pull Request review has been completed with passing checks you will either have a merge to a stable or a development version to be released in a stable release in time as our schedule provides, and if your pull request gets closed it doesn`t mean it will forever close! You always have an open discussion with a reason and the opportunity for future considerations for your change to improve the codebase as the system grows needs change to adapt accordingly.

## 8. Coding Standards

Follow PEP 8 style guide consistently across codebase with all files, for code. Indentation with consistent spacing, maximum lines should remain 79 and consistent naming conventions with variables or classes and the documentation strings with proper docstrings in your contributions, all aid contributors with understanding and clarity!

Employing Linters (such as `flake8` or `pylint`) ensures your code adheres Python standard conventions and to ensure the quality. The automated linters and code formatters helps ensure a higher standard across contribution for a higher degree. Type Checking with MyPy allows you with static-typing to check types. Documentation with clear and descriptive Docstrings, for classes/function and their inputs is standards to allow others understanding your code quickly.

## 9. Testing Guidelines

Existing test coverage can be viewed from within root and you need to ensure new contributions pass our testing framework.  To verify existing functionality, simply `python -m pytest`. You need a `pytest.ini` to specify configuration, but we've preconfigured with basic parameters! Adding your changes needs tests, especially on critical paths to prevent issues in later builds

Ensure the framework can run on your changes. Unit by individual component and Integration tests which test how various modules and features combine is highly appreciated with the testing approach of Controls! A suite regression that validates new functionality works without breaking anything. Regression Testing can be performed after changes to check the framework.  A testing strategy that provides the right balance and quality, helps with maintainability of the platform in a continuous ecosystem, as more contributions are expected, more validation becomes necessary for long term growth and scalability of a larger system

## 10. Documentation Contributions

Update any relevant document in Markdown format and stored in `/docs` directory with new or improved information and descriptions of functionality! The structure follows `README` style documentation so maintain consistency! We have an automated document system so please review changes and update any necessary information accordingly with our IDE to ensure quality documentation

We welcome all contributions that improves accessibility for our community and to enhance their experiences using Controls with better explanations! Consistency on terminology helps ensure clear documentation, especially across the platform and across users! Clarity in the language used to explain core components allows developers a lasting learning experiences.

## 11. Commit Message Guidelines

Each Commit must describe change. Start the messages using keyword. Common usage can follow convention such as using prefixes. A clear commit title, describing in detail of a short phrase and body describing changes to assist maintain release and debug purposes. Conventional Commits with format: `feat: new features`,  `fix: issue fixes`,  `docs: Documentation changes.` provides improvement and allows automation of the change!

Consistent format of commits aids in understanding what each contribution contains! The concise description on a single sentence is best and should not span multiple paragraphs for enhanced comprehension of change to improve ease and efficiency of the contribution!

## 12. Branching Model

Currently uses Git Flow, maintaining separate feature and develop/main versions and a `main` stable production code base. Branch off a new Feature or `Fix` branch for contribution and not on `main`. This allows for stability of main, for a single, consistent build that's easy to release in different environments or production scenarios!

The branch off development to revert back and maintain code safety in development, to ensure the core code doesn;t break during contribution phases as it will aid developers. A consistent strategy helps developers maintain the codebase in order without conflicting.  Clear separation of concerns and stable code, helps in maintain a larger framework as time progresses with increasing features, for scalability to improve the usage for everyone!

## 13. Review Process

Each PR requires thorough assessment before acceptance into framework with multiple eyes and testing with all changes incorporated, before acceptance in production to minimize potential regressions. Feedback should include comments and clear expectations that allows the maintainer a quick turnaround time! We are always happy to have discussion for changes in code, especially on more significant ones to ensure the framework maintains the correct design patterns for all contributors to benefit

Timeliness, in delivering reviews in timely, ensures that contributors maintain engagement and momentum of contributions in framework which will improve development velocity as we move forward in the long term for future releases. Post Merge we run full automated builds that are deployed in various test stages with monitoring to detect and quickly revert any unexpected regressions and allow for iterative updates

## 14. Communication Channels

You can attend our open discussions on `Slack: channels/#ControlsFrameworkDevelopment` with a more real time engagement! If issues require direct support and discussion can be opened via `GitHub` in Issues to track all discussions related! A formal forum and communication is important in the development for the long-term, which provides the framework an easier and accessible communication!

We want open lines and clear discussions and encourage all contributors, from novice developers to experienced domain professionals with questions for clarity of the current contributing framework in place and open-minded discussions of new improvements!  Our collective goal to improve this system and create a collaborative atmosphere is important with an emphasis of inclusivity, where all voices matter, in creating Controls, together.

## 15. Security and Responsible Disclosure

Please be responsible in communicating with the vulnerabilities of Control. Avoid disclosure, but engage the Security channels and contact the team via `email security@controlsframework.org`, and we will handle it! Responsible and secure communication will keep data protected with minimal risks for end-users and contributors involved within framework ecosystem.

Reporting of all bugs and issues, allows us with more time to address these vulnerabilities, while protecting all end users. Security audits is always encouraged across contributors so to identify all edge and boundary issues within the code which provides the overall security! Confidential reports allows for greater and better response with minimizing public impact!

## 16. Release Process

Releases happen periodically, based on milestones that are determined from our product and project roadmaps. We follow a Stable Semantic Version and the releases include a Changelog and versioning for all components. A tagging and branching approach ensures each version can run with no dependencies!

New changes that go live requires a rigorous validation to minimize regression!  A release candidate version can go in testing environments that provides the opportunity for the last check and validations for release of stable and tested builds of incorporated features, with continuous validation and testing

## 17. Recognition

Recognizing our contributions, ensures we keep a sense of belonging, for continuous engagement. Maintainers will recognize key changes within Changelogs or contribute to the website for visibility! This encourages quality of work for all! Contributions are important! We will keep a track on contribution metrics. 

Consistent and clear communication and feedback is critical and allows to encourage maintain a community of trust and recognition to foster the open and collaborative approach that builds higher standards of the Controls Platform

## 18. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributors should sign CA before contributions! We need to understand how code will used with the legal agreements in a formal setting! It defines legal perms for our Contributors, which provides an avenue where we have protection to ensure code is not abused for malicious purpose with contributed features to our Frameworks

A full link for our agreements for review on https://example.com/CLA/ and sign with all required information on our agreement, for formalizing and agreeing that code provided by you will be used and managed under a specific framework.
