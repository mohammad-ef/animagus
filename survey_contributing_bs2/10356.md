# CONTRIBUITING. MD for the "Example Project"


Welcome! This repository powers our open 'Example Project,' a tool designed [describe the tool concisely, one to  four line explanation]. We greatly appreciate any contributions made to our open source tool. Contributing enhances project usability, improves reliability and helps expand it in unexpected ways that a few of us could achieve alone. Your involvement, regardless the contribution, is invaluable!


The open development process is what makes open source successful. We strive for a healthy and supportive ecosystem, so we ask your help and support. We value diverse viewpoints to improve our project' as a whole so everyone who participates benefits equally and enjoys contributing


We also welcome any assistance from users. Even non-technical assistance like reporting usability issues on the user experience helps immensely. Your time is respected and appreciated. Please see our Code of Conduct (see next section.) to ensure all contributions are made with respect towards fellow team- members.

### <br/>  **Code Of Conuct** 

We are dedicated in building community of respectful collaboration, inclusivity, and welcoming everyone involved to contribute their knowledge, regardless skills, backgrounds, or opinions. Our aim is foster a secure environment, which means we expect a professional attitude and a constructive dialog amongst our contributors at all instances of engagement


This code governs all contributions to 'Example Project, regardless format, and it includes participation via GitHub or other channels (e..g email, discussions forums), We are not to permit harassing behaviour, or any discriminatory action towards others within the community. Please see our official policy for comprehensive details. 

We encourage contributors to speak respectfully when interacting. Open discussions are welcome, especially those that challenge or suggest improvement on existing solutions and code but, always in the interest to improve our project. This commitment to respect and constructive dialogue ensures all voices have value. Violations may result disciplinary or even being prohibited access for future collaboration. 

  ### 
<br /> **Getting Startend** 

To get started with development, you need to clone our repo into a development environment on your device. The repo is on Github located [Insert GitHub repository address.]. We use Git version management which is essential for collaborative project management 

Next, navigate through the cloned repo and execute commands to build dependencies to install any packages needed (e g. node_modules or dependencies file, etc.). A good approach might use commands as follows:`npm install` (If Node project)or `yarn install` to get your dependencies working

After installation and setup, it's important to create local working branch so any modifications are isolated to the branch. Create your new feature/ branch via a command such as :`git switch -c feat/new feature` which makes it easy isolate changes before committing


Once dependencies is setup, you may be able build project with simple build command: `npm builld or ./gralde task build.` This builds a deploy able package for our tool so it runs properly. 

  
Now, you're setup, and prepared to start modifying project and contributing changes. Ensure your changes build successfully by running tests. Please check the Testing Guidelines sections below for instructions to build and test your work. 

### 
<br /> **How Can I Contriubte **

We are glad when people join the development. This project thrives by many, small, incremental updates, so any contributions are welcomed to our tool to enhance our project. This project supports many avenues for engagement from small, to large changes and improvements across many disciplines

If an issue is blocking the progress or you found bug, feel completely safe raising this to us. Detailed issues and bug descriptions with the steps to repeat the issue, is greatly encouraged to allow us to fix these more swiftly. 

Feature requests also welcome and encouraged to allow project evolve over- time and address new use-cases. If a feature idea sounds good to us we would be glad discuss further and possibly prioritize its incorporation. 

Updating documentation or fixing grammar and spelling in our docs is a great place to start as a contributor, it is easy entry point. We encourage to maintain the accuracy clarity, and accessibility across entire docs. 


###  **Reproting Bugs **

If you stumble on issues and/ or bug while running 'Example Program, kindly report it by first searching existing ones, to see they have addressed and resolved already. You can see open issues via GitHub issues tab: [Provide URL here to issue tracker page in project repository ]

Next, when generating reports, be concise and detailed with the steps to repeat the issue, to allow us to debug it quickly. Including the versions of the tools, libraries, the operating system is greatly important to help resolve bug. Also attach screenshots, video, or any other information that is necessary for resolution 

To effectively create reproducible bug report, ensure that steps can easily repeat and debug, to resolve bug as soon and quickly, so our team will resolve this swiftly. 



  
If a bug persists across various machines, it likely indicates a fundamental issue within core codebase, which is valuable finding, that would allow team to address. If bug doesn' affect other functionality, consider reporting to us so team can investigate

###  **Sugestin Enhancmements** 

We encourage contributors to suggest new enhancements that would improve tool functionality, usability. If a enhancement aligns with overall purpose, we are willing incorporate into project. 

Feature requests should outline use case that the feature will serve, and explain benefits to project users. This information will assist our development team in determining feasibility, priorities

Before implementing an idea, consider engaging a short discussion with the maintainers or team, to gauge feedback on the design, feasibility, or required work for it. This approach helps reduce redundant, and wasted work

To submit an improvement suggestion or feature, create issue via GitHub issues tab and provide the detailed description, the motivation of the feature request. This way maintain team can quickly address requests to incorporate them in roadmap

### **Pull Request Process **
1 Create new local, branch based from `origin/` (when starting development), with appropriate, descriptive naming (feature-branch or bugfix-something etc)
2.  Write code or modifications and follow coding standards described in this file
2  Run all existing unit tests, or any relevant functional tests that impact modifications.
3 Test and ensure that changes build without errors in local development environment
4. Commit changes and push branch via Github command: 

```
git commit -m 'Commit message' 
git fetch --all
  git branch -u origin/feature branch
git push
```
5. Submit pull request and add detailed review description
6. Maintain and address feedback comments and required changes, before merging

###
<br/> **Coding StandaRDS **
The project aims follow a standardized coding approach so our team maintainability, read ability, and consistency of code base. The standard we enforce, follow a Google code style guidelines with additional, project specific modifications. 
All code changes need to conform, to our standards. If not, maintain and contributors will ask adjustments, before merging PR to `main branch`. 

We encourage contributors follow standard formatting and linting, to enforce these. This way maintain code quality consistently across all changes to ensure consistency of code
We have a pre- configured linting and type checks using [mention tool here] configured to automatically flag coding issues. Please make a note of linting warnings, errors during development
To ensure all coding standard and linting checks pass. Ensure to follow the conventions, so it will not be an blocker for a PR. 

  

### **Testing Guidelines**

We have a test framework [mention framework name] to test the project, which allows the developers to build and test code easily. 
The unit tests are placed into the `./tests or ./src-test folder`. Integration tests are placed at `./Integration folder`. Run existing unit and tests by typing [Mention test running commands]

New unit tests for any code modification are mandatory, so all the new code is adequately, tested before integration of code base, as it ensures, high- quality, stable, code base
Write both unit/ regression and tests to ensure changes don't impact existing features, and all new features function correctly and robustly as per project requirements 


### **Documenation Contriibution** 
Project documentation located in `/docs folder` or in the `/website folder `. Any contributions to improve, enhance docs is greatly welcomed. 

If updating docs, ensure, it is consistent, and easy to understand. Ensure to use correct grammar, sentence structure for improved understand ability. We encourage using markdown to enhance formatting in our docs 

We encourage contributors to update, enhance, or fix grammatical mistakes in the documents. It helps our users understand tool easily, and improves user adoption. Ensure that all updates are properly tested for consistency.

### ** Commit Message Guideline**

Commits messages should be concise descriptive that describe nature, purpose of change being made to codebase
Use conventional commits for all your commits, for a standardized commit message format. The common commit types includes feature, bugfix, style, breaking change, docs etc. 



  Use prefix of `feat:`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `chore:` etc. with brief explanation of modification in commit messages. This will aid us to easily, understand commit history
Commit messages are essential for maintaining, code readability, debugging, code auditing in team, so write concise meaningful commits. 

### **Branching Model**

Project adopts `git flow model`. The `main` represents stable, production-ready codebase and `develop represents`, integrated development, branch 
New feature, enhancements and bug fix branches created, and branched from `develop` for isolation, of development changes from master

All code merged, back to `develop` after review, validation testing. `main` will receive merge only from develop to stabilize codebase after release 

  ### 


 ### ** Review Prcocess **

We review PR thoroughly, before approval for merging to ensure quality. This is an incremental review that includes checking style guides coding standards compliance to project, requirements.
Reviewers will provide feedback or requests additional testing to ensure functionality works correctly. We aim provide feedback within `24-72 hrs`. Please address, comments quickly.

  

Once, code is reviewed, approved by maintain, merge will happen and changes are reflected in main repository.
