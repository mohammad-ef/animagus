# Contributors Guildines for Acme Project

## 1. Introduction

This project is more than just source code; it is the collective endeavor and passion of a global community of engineers and creators. We are committed in making the experience seamless by encouraging everyone to be part of building, refining, and maintaining the code, and documentation that empowers our community. We encourage anyone from anywhere in timezones, backgrounds, genders, races to join.   

Contributing to the development of the Acme Project, means directly impactting the lives of those benefiting from its usage and capabilities. Your expertise, insights, and dedication, whether it' s a minor code tweak or major functionality, contributes to the continued success of the Acme Ecosystem as a whole.    

We value contributions that help us maintain a high bar of quality, documentation, and accessibility. This can extend to improving our tests as much improving features, documentation, or bug fixes. Your engagement helps to create something bigger than each of ourselves. We encourage non-coding contributions like improving readability, accessibility or helping to organize. Let’s work together to build something amazing!

## 2. Code of Conduct

We want to ensure an accessible, collaborative, and positive open source journey for contributors. Everyone interacting with the project, whether in code, documentation, communication, and community, should be respectful toward all participants to maintain a friendly, constructive environment.

We expect contributors to be considerate, welcoming in their interactions. Please avoid offensive or disparaging language, and treat every other member with a baseline of kindness. If a situation requires it, address conflicts privately and professionally, seeking guidance if you need help with that approach.

Inappropriate behavior, including harassment (whether sexual, personal, or otherwise ), discrimination, and offensive communication, and will not tolerated, in any context and will not be excused under any circumstances. Repeated violations of these standards may lead to a ban from the project, as well as a formal reporting to our community leadership.

Respect, and a positive approach to all participants, is the bedrock of our open source ethos; it is our shared expectation, our mutual benefit and a reflection of the values that bind us and drive our shared goal.

## 3. Getting Started

To get started, it helps to set up the environment. First and foremost, it' the best to familiarize ourselves with our repo on the cloud, typically using GitHub (e g, forking, creating an accout if you do not have one). Clone down the relevant repository, so you have the files to work with. 

Once it is downloaded onto your machine, you' will likely want to install any needed prerequisites. Typically the `INSTALL.md file`, which should be included in the repo, provides details regarding dependencies such as Python, Javascript and required libraries. Please read through the file before continuing.  

Branching rules are crucial. When you have forked and cloned your own copy of the repository, create separate local branches for individual features or bug fixes. Name the branches following a convention such as: feature/new-feature, fix/bugfix and docs/documentation updates. Do not work directly on main.

Next, build the software using the project setup instructions.  This may mean executing the `npm install` (for frontend) or `setup.py install` ( for backends) commands, which installs all the required dependencies. The specific installation and build processes will vary depending on the codebase, so it' important to follow any provided instructions precisely.

## 4. How to Contribute

There are many ways to get involved!  We appreciate any help improving the project, regardless of expertise. You might find yourself fixing bugs, adding new features, or helping with documentation and providing guidance, and we would appreciate any assistance that can get us closer together. 

We also encourage you to submit suggestions for new features and improvements to enhance the user experience, expand functionality or add support, as well improving testing coverage across the project, and making documentation accessible across the community as well. We are always looking for feedback, and new ideas and directions.

Before starting a significant implementation, consider discussing the changes with other contributors. This will help identify potential pitfalls, and also align the changes with the goals and direction of project. Creating a new issue or engaging in discussion threads on the project's communication channels, like Discord and Slack, may prove effective.    

We welcome improvements to the documentation as much as we do bug fixes, so feel free submit any improvements you deem to be relevant for improving clarity and understanding across the ecosystem of our software and users. We are also always open to suggestions from our users, and the best way is to file a suggestion as a GitHub discussion.   

To report an issue, go to the "Issues" page within your forked repo and submit a detailed report describing the bug. For new features, open a "Feature Request" issue, providing as much information as possible. To create documentation, edit the existing documentation.   

 

   

## 5. Reporting Bugs

When submitting a new issue, please make your report as descriptive as possible, with a detailed explanation, and a link to GitHub if applicable, to provide context. It is best to provide a detailed, reproducible, clear, and step-by-step instructions.

A clear title is also a key component of your issue, and it should concisely describe the bug in an easily identifiable, clear language that can be quickly and directly read. Please ensure you are providing as much detail as necessary, which should allow our team to fully understand the scope of issues and resolve them quickly.

When reporting a bug, ensure you are checking that the issue has not yet been raised by a contributor before submitting a new issue. A thorough check of the issue tracker on the repository can help eliminate duplicates.

Finally, to aid the reproduction of the issue, consider adding a log file, if applicable for your specific case. A log provides valuable debugging information that can assist the developers in resolving the issue, as it can often highlight specific areas for further investigation as a starting point.    

## <font color="red "> **All issues and documentation must contain a title to be properly addressed** 

<hr color="blue ">
## 6. Suggesting Enhancements

We are committed to the continuous improvement of the Acme Project, and we welcome ideas for new features and enhancements. To submit a well-formed and well-considered enhancement request:

First, open a new "Feature Request" issue, providing a clear, succinct, and comprehensive explanation of the enhancement, its intended purpose, and potential user benefits. Please provide a detailed explanation, including any potential use cases for this functionality.    

Second, consider including a mock-up, diagrams, or any other visual aids that can help illustrate the idea and facilitate a common understanding with the rest of the contributors and core team. This can be a useful way for developers to grasp the concept.

Our maintainers carefully review all feature requests, considering their alignment with project goals, feasibility, and potential for broad user adoption before moving them into the pipeline for prioritization or implementation.  We' will provide updates on their progress within a reasonable timeframe, keeping our users and community apprised.    

Finally, remember, all enhancements must adhere to existing guidelines, so it is critical to align with project standards, so the integration will prove seamless and consistent with the existing code, and architecture.  

## <font color="red "> **Feature suggestions must include a detailed description, potential use cases, and mockups** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 7. Pull Request Process

To submit a pull request, make sure you have branched using:
 ```bash
 git checkout - b feature/branch-name
  ```
Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages. After committing, push the code from your feature branch to the fork.

Next, create a new pull request from your fork's branch to the Acme main or development branch. Write a detailed pull request description, outlining the intended functionality, the changes made, and any potential impact on existing features or the broader ecosystem.

Our maintain team reviews each PR thoroughly for style, functionality, and adherence to the established standards. They may provide feedback to improve the solution or identify potential issues. Please be receptive to their feedback, addressing issues and iterating on your code as necessary, so the integration will prove seamless and consistent with the existing ecosystem.

Following a successful review, including automated testing, the PR will be merged into the project, incorporating its contributions and extending its reach within the larger Acme universe to the wider world.     

## <font color="red "> **PRs must be merged following code and testing review from all stakeholders**     

<hr color="blue ">

## 8. Coding Standards

We adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for Python, and the Google JavaScript Style Guide for JavaScript. These standards promote code readability and consistency, and contribute to a maintainable base of code. We encourage the use of code linters (flake8 for Python and ESLint for JavaScript) that ensure code follows the established guidelines.

To ensure consistency, we use pre-commit hooks to automatically check for formatting, linting, and type checking before a change is committed. This reduces the risk of introducing code that does not meet style requirements and helps maintain a high-quality base of code.   

We require detailed documentation for all functions, classes, and modules, ensuring that the code is easily understandable by both developers and end-users alike. Documentation should be accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date to facilitate collaboration, and ensure code longevity and maintainability.      

We encourage contributors to use a consistent naming convention, and to avoid abbreviations and acronyms. Code should strive to be expressive and easy to understand, and avoid overly complicated or abstract logic that may hinder understanding across all contributors and users alike.  

## <font color = "red "> **Code must be PEP 8- compliant, using a pre- commit system that runs automatically before committing new content** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 9. Testing Guidelines

Thorough testing helps to guarantee the reliability, functionality, and stability of the Acme Project, enabling users to trust in our solutions and confidently integrate their software into the Acme Project ecosystem.   

To start, make sure existing tests are run before submitting a pull request. This can be done by executing the `pytest` (for Python) or `jest` (for JavaScript) commands, as defined in the relevant setup file, to ensure no regression is created.

We utilize a combination of unit, integration and regression tests across all areas of the project. Write new tests when submitting a PR, especially when new functionality is implemented or when a bug is fixed, to help prevent regression and increase stability.   

We expect tests to be well-written, readable, and comprehensive, to cover all the necessary functionality and edge- cases. All tests should be automated, meaning the tests must run without manual intervention, which facilitates continuous and reliable testing, and ensures quality across the entire project as a whole.      

We welcome the use of any testing frameworks, but it's best to adhere to the existing, widely recognized, frameworks, and tools, such as pytest, Jest, and similar frameworks to facilitate ease of contribution, and seamless maintenance.   

## <font color = "blue "> **All tests are automated, and well documented, following established frameworks** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 10. Documentation Contributions

To update or improve documentation, edit the relevant Markdown files ( `.md`) located under the `docs` folder within the repository, ensuring that all edits comply with the established style and tone across all existing docs. We are committed in keeping all existing files, documentation readable and accurate, ensuring all changes conform.   

We encourage clear writing styles to avoid confusing wording or complex sentence structuring that could lead to potential difficulties with user adoption of Acme products and projects across different user demographics.

To make contributions easier to read, it best practice to preview and test all updates within documentation on your personal development machine, using an appropriate viewer or build tools as available before creating and pushing the contribution across a public branch. 

For significant structural revisions, open a new GitHub discussion for a collaborative design approach to maintain consistent structure of existing files, while aiming to deliver new improved, streamlined, well defined files as appropriate.   

All files under documentation are version controlled by the system and can easily and effectively undergo version history. All contributors must make efforts to avoid making disruptive, or confusing alterations without consultation from core members to maintain consistent quality standards for end-users, or other interested collaborators alike.   
  
## <font color="blue "> **Doc updates and modifications require careful formatting with a new branch that can easily revert and be edited**  

<hr color="blue ">
## 11. Commit Message Guidelines

To keep things manageable, and improve readability to maintain a streamlined workflow with a shared vision: Use the following structure, with appropriate prefix to identify what changes occurred: "Prefix (scope): Commit subject ". 

Commit subjects, which follow these with the prefixes (feat: added a new component), (fix: resolve issue) or (docs: update docs). The scope identifies area that was impacted by code (feat: api-user: new api endpoints); The short sentence following is clear and explains why changes occurred in a concise, and well formed language, which make code easy to follow as contributors and user- base work in tandem and grow the software as one.   

Use clear commit messaging to make future debugging easy, or quickly find what has gone where without spending valuable resources trying to decipher and follow what has previously happened to code over time with previous contributions to this repository. Commit messaging helps keep all involved aligned with changes that took place over an iterative, and dynamic, workflow of contribution from contributors worldwide and from a multitude of experience level to help build this Acme Ecosystem and product to greatness!    

Consistent, concise commit history improves team understanding and helps streamline our project development workflow across our entire project base with contributors and core development and management. All new code must abide to our commit rules and guidelines and all changes are monitored to keep a consistent and maintainable workflow as a standard practice amongst the entire group of stakeholders working towards the success and longevity of the Project's code. 

## <font color = "red "> **All new Commits, must conform with Commit- Message standards for best readability!**

<hr color="blue ">
## 12. Branching Model

This project primarily adheres to a **Git flow branching model**. Our approach helps us keep code in order as the number of users and features continues to scale, ensuring we deliver a stable base product that is reliable in its delivery across multiple users, devices, locations and platforms, with high availability for those that require this service from time to time or for general daily tasks as the case requires it. 

We branch out the main and release branches. New features will originate on the "feature branches". Fixes on production issues originate from "hotfix branches" that are created on `main`. 

To make any contributions for development: create the new development feature using your `forking and pull` process as a starting process for contributing towards a larger, unified, project goal, and merge back into development once modified with the latest fixes, or new implementations.    

When working on any branch from main for a specific contribution: follow best industry standards in using meaningful naming standards for new feature branch, and be prepared to work as collaborative and unified contributor with team. We strive and value team efforts in keeping quality of work and code high to meet all the goals for each contribution to Acme!

   

## <font color="blue "> **Follow GitFlow standards: `main`, `develop`, `feature`, and `hotfix` for branching workflows.***  

<hr color="blue ">
## 13. Review Process

Every PR, and contribution goes through careful, diligent code reviews. Maintainers are reviewing code for functionality and alignment and to make improvements across multiple axes for a unified strategy across contributors and team.    

Expect thoughtful constructive comments on potential improvements or bugs despite the code. It important that you remain positive with suggestions for code or other contributions so as not to cause a hostile workflow or any other form of disruption that is unnecessary. Be sure, as the team moves to a more agile state of being that all contributions remain in-step to keep up. 

Once PR reviews have all been successfully concluded with sign-off: we perform a suite of comprehensive unit and end-to-end, especially to test any regressions, so we know everything still functions in expected and predictable manners before merging it across the ecosystem!  All merges across the ecosystem follow a streamlined release and update process with all parties and contributors aware, to prevent disruption of workflows as it continues towards success!    

## <font color = "red "> **Ensure PR are properly merged across system to keep everything stable for team contributions as well, while following established workflows.**

<hr color="blue ">
## 14. Communication Channels

Reach out with a question or concern by posting your issue or concerns as discussion threads to the relevant project GitHub page or issue board, allowing everyone in real time can contribute. If a private chat/conversation may require you: use our private channels for communication and to keep sensitive or non-open communication away from general view, such as in dedicated private discord, slack groups.   

Maintain respectful open collaboration across contributors. As with our standards regarding code-behavior: We are a professional, happy group to build the ecosystem as best and as strong we possibly can for all contributors!   

Our goal and aim to foster open discussions in the best interests for contributors. If we are not available, or there is not sufficient resources across core, it takes an extra effort, as our group may vary in schedules with different location-times zones for contributors. Please take care of yourself.

## <font color = "blue "> **Open discussion with the wider world can result in many improvements. Please do engage! *** 

<hr color="blue ">
## 15. Security and Responsible Disclosure

We value security! Should a potential, and known or potential bug: contact us immediately with all necessary information in order to prevent disruption of service to all involved users! It important that any sensitive issues do not reach open-source disclosure before the team addresses. We will keep the contributors, users abreast in order to help them stay protected with updates that prevent these vulnerabilities or issues with potential disruption and loss from occurring with any users or contributors!     

A designated contact person/ email should always reach the relevant parties in-the- know with the potential risks that have to occur in order to maintain our standard. All contact must abide by professional behavior across parties in keeping security a paramount issue and top priority, and to help us resolve quickly as the issue presents across users or across all potential systems!     
All contact will result in timely communication across our core and users!

## <font color= "red "> **Any Security related incidents: report them promptly to designated channels in private to protect against vulnerabilities. *** 

<hr color="blue ">

## 16. Release Process

We plan on following SemVer. All code will adhere strictly and will result from the agreed process for release across all systems involved to prevent errors that could impact end-user adoption, and general adoption by a global audience as required.

Once approved through rigorous reviews for changes from multiple parties and sign-off on all aspects across contributors to our codebase across multiple locations globally! Changes get incorporated to tag a stable, reliable, version to be deployed to public. A changelog must include any modifications for transparency and awareness as the software moves into production, and eventually gets used as required in our world, to support users with updates to the code as the project and codebase grows with contributions!     

Use the automated system and use a standardized process as it is the easiest path and to maintain our goals of keeping our systems as simple, transparent and easy-going and as easy to navigate! 

## <font color =  "red "> **Code release must abide the existing standards, to maintain consistency for contributors worldwide and keep everything aligned.***  

<hr color="blue ">

## 17. Recognition

Contributions help improve quality. Contributors, in their turn, can expect visibility. This includes contributor list for code contributions or credit on documentation! All of these actions helps to improve visibility as code improves, users get involved in our community across locations, as users help us to keep it alive through critical code improvements and contributions as needed in order to improve our value. 

It also encourages contributors as they can see what their work and efforts are valued! As we all contribute across a large scale with the project and its ecosystem. It can lead us toward the same ultimate vision! All users must remain committed in helping our shared dream come into realization with each new day, and all changes in steps forward!       

Keep contributing, as that is the greatest reward!   

## <font color = "blue "> **Maintain a high- quality product, with high consistency for a unified community, to see a great quality project grow across multiple ecosystems across different stakeholders involved worldwide ***

<hr color="blue ">

## 18. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To prevent potential issues, and inconsistencies, the Acme team uses and relies upon CLA's across numerous projects in which we have to rely. A Contributor License Agreement needs signing to allow for contributions as our standard process, as we continue to work towards our unified, and streamlined approach!      

All new contributions and changes must adhere with our standards and policies across stakeholders in order to continue the work in this model. As the code is used in many commercial products as we go: the agreements protect everyone! 

You must agree on terms with this in writing and sign our form prior contribution of content into any Acme ecosystem to legally permit it. 

## <font color= "red "> **To continue work in our systems across locations globally and legally ensure everyone is covered with our agreement*** 

<hr color="blue ">
## 19. Resources and References

PEP8 standards across programming language: 

<https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/> Google JavaStyle guidelines :<https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascript/>.   
The documentation across all platforms for each individual system, and vendor can often provide additional resources as they may change across different libraries, platforms, languages or locations across our ecosystem as time marches on.    

Always be willing to collaborate to keep the community and standards in place across multiple platforms across locations worldwide and across all ecosystems to help maintain high code, accessibility as well quality standards. We welcome your help!
