# How We Contribute

Welcome! We're thrilled you expressed interest in contributing to our project. Contributions of any size, from bug reports to large features, are warmly welcome as they are vital fuel for our progress and growth of the project ecosystem.

Open source is driven by its people and their shared efforts. By joining us, you'll contribute to an evolving community dedicated to improving the project and making it the tool people rely on. We value the knowledge, experience and enthusiasm that new community members bring.

We believe in making this a welcoming and supportive environment. Your participation, regardless of your experience level, will significantly contribute to the project’s quality and longevity. So let’s get right into how to do so and contribute meaningfully.


 # Code of Conduct

 We expect everyone to treat collaborators, visitors and community in a kind and respectful manner and contribute to a supportive ecosystem. We value collaboration, and we strive to create an inviting space where all individuals feel safe and encouraged to share ideas and work together.

 Harassment, discrimination, or any behaviour that undermines a welcoming environment will not be tolerated and results in being asked to leave the collaboration as well as possible legal action as determined on a case by case basis. We are committed to maintaining a professional and constructive community environment.

 We encourage everyone to be empathetic and mindful of the impact that comments can have. Remember that online communications can be easily taken the wrong way, so it is essential to communicate with respect and understanding to foster a positive working atmosphere that allows all to contribute and grow. We all learn from each other as contributors as this community is built upon shared experience! 


# Getting Started 

Before contributing, you must set up our local development environment and clone the project. First, fork the repository on GitHub. Then, clone your fork locally using  `git clone <your_fork_URL>`. Navigate into the cloned directory using `cd <project_name >`.

Next, you should install necessary tools. For example, you might install `Node.js` with version at least `16.x` using a package manager of your choosing. Then you should install project dependencies via the appropriate means for the language. We use `npm install` to do so, which can be run within the project root folder after Node.js is installed.

To start development, you will need to configure an editor and a Git client for local changes. Make your changes to your local environment, committing frequently while developing. Ensure that each branch reflects a single goal, which helps with review and testing.

We use Git Flow branching model for our projects, which will be further explained later within this file. Create a new branch by checking out a new local branch using the command `git checkout -b <feature_name >` for each feature or fix you work on. 

Finally, before submitting, make sure all local changes are pushed to your forked repository. This enables a smoother contribution experience as you prepare for submitting a merge request.



# How to Contribute 

There are many ways to help improve the project, both through code and non-code contributions. You can submit bug reports, contribute to documentation, help with testing, suggest enhancements and even provide design feedback.

If you find a bug, please report it. If you notice areas where the documentation can improve, go ahead and update it with your knowledge. Every contribution helps the project grow. 

When implementing new changes, especially larger ones or complex refactorings please communicate your intentions by first creating an issue and discussing the implementation before you implement it to ensure that the work meets our expectations. This also avoids wasted effort if the proposed approach needs adjustments.

Before submitting a pull request with code, it is critical that you ensure your tests pass, and your code follows our established style conventions and coding standards. This ensures code compatibility and reduces review burden on contributors, as we prioritize consistency as an open source community.


# Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, please provide as much information as possible, which makes reproducing the issue easy for triage contributors to address efficiently. The ideal bug report contains steps to reproduce, your operating system, version, browser etc.. The most useful thing that a developer can find within your bug is reproducible instructions and the state when this bug was created.

A clear and concise description is also important, along with screenshots or recordings where applicable. The bug is easily reproducible, so please provide a short and self-explanatory description. If your code produces a stack trace then providing the entire message as is.

We utilize GitHub Issues to track bug reports. Search for existing issues first to avoid duplicates. Create a new issue with a descriptive title, clear description, and necessary steps to reliably recreate the problem to aid our developers' debugging processes. 



# Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement? Share it by creating an issue. Be clear about what you propose and *why* it benefits the project. Describe potential use cases and provide examples to make your suggestion as concrete as possible.

Please include any specific constraints or trade-offs to consider if you see it from these lenses, as it will greatly aid in evaluating feasibility of this new idea as our project continues to develop and adapt to the world's requirements! We prioritize features and enhancement submissions in order of their benefit for most frequent usages as the team grows larger,

Our maintainers review all suggestions. This review includes feasibility evaluation, and resource requirements to evaluate potential costs associated. The priority is then assessed by considering the potential benefit and impact for other developers as a project-wide consideration and we may contact you for clarifications.



# Pull Request Process

To submit changes, create a pull request (PR) from your forked repository, against our main development branch. Name your branch clearly according to the purpose it addresses, such as `feature/new-functionality`. We use this standardized branching convention. 

Make sure to follow commit conventions as mentioned at the later parts of this contribution process, including messages to ensure that each one clearly describes your intent to enable a review workflow, with easy-to-parse logs that will make the code more efficient along its lifecycle. After creating your branch and adding changes commit with `git commit -m 'Your informative explanation'`.  Push your changes `git push origin <branch_name>`.

Whenever the branch contains significant changes and/or code, be prepared to explain what each of them is to a maintainer. After submission of PR it undergoes several checks for quality including consistent coding practices to avoid code-wide inconsistencies across contributors. Once passed we expect that it will pass code-wide integration and unit tests, with all failures reported as actionable tasks, so please ensure your work covers most edge cases as a standard before submission!  

After the tests pass and the code passes review the changes are incorporated by maintainers via an appropriate process within their Git setup for a final push for a merged version that is available across everyone. 



# Coding Standards

To keep the codebase maintainable and easy to understand, we use strict coding style guidelines, using standard coding styles and naming practices as standards throughout development and testing stages. Adherence is mandatory, which improves team productivity!

We prefer Python style using `pep8` as style reference as this will allow easier debugging across the ecosystem of open-sourced Python applications. The use of a `pylint` linting configuration is used during the automated tests that checks the code for consistency with PEP 8 standards, so your contributions pass our style validation process before merging, so your pull requests pass without any stylistic feedback, reducing merge times,

We encourage you to install pre-commit hooks that will enforce our formatting guidelines automatically and catch any stylistic discrepancies before merging into code base to ensure a more fluid review flow across development team as they prepare their next submissions!




# Testing Guidelines

Tests ensure code functions correctly across diverse operating and environmental conditions. Our testing framework is based around Python using pytest, where it runs automatically when tests need to run in our continuous deployment and testing setup pipeline

Write both unit and integration tests as a part of submitting changes. Ensure tests pass on both local machine as well before creating and/or pushing pull requests as well to prevent any delays that come as a cost for fixing failing integration and testing setups across all branches that contribute and are updated, and maintain consistent workflow and efficiency across our contributors!  

When adding a new functionality, ensure that it comes accompanied with comprehensive testing and carefully review any edge case conditions, such as negative values in mathematical formulas that must handle without throwing exception! These tests need to work seamlessly to enable easy and safe integration across multiple platforms and use-cases of code.




# Documentation Contributions

Good documentation makes project much more understandable to others that use them and allows contributors to onboard and work fluently and consistently to feel comfortable with project architecture

Documentation can exist in different ways and in many different styles so be open to adapting the project as necessary when writing it in organization and presentation to enable clarity across all contributors as they adapt into their new environments! We primarily keep project's API documentations using ReStructuredText with the ability to export the project's code base and its documentations, as they are often read together to provide better overall experience.

The location of files that contain documents will also vary as project changes. Be attentive when editing or creating new document as a way to improve project clarity in an ever-changing environment!





# Commit Message Guidelines

Write clean, descriptive commit messages to explain *why* you made each change, which is helpful for maintainers to trace down and follow project changes across development history as a team effort across various collaborators as it scales and improves, and enables better overall understanding of each code change across all branches.

Follow the convention, where your title line should briefly explain your commit purpose, using keywords for the type and short descriptions such as using a standard for commit messaging (eg "feat: adding authentication") to ensure consistency for contributors that allows for quick comprehension of intent. This is especially crucial as projects evolve.

Commit message titles explain purpose of code. Detailed descriptions, and context of change, can appear under a single line separator with 72 characters and it allows us as developers to better review code for quality purposes and to understand changes and potential impact as contributors come along! 



# Branching Model

We adhere to a simplified Gitflow strategy. This helps maintain code quality. `main` is always the production-ready code base as a final output to our clients, so do maintain this as pristine and untouched as possible at all costs! 

When working on a feature create `feature/<branch_name>` off the latest release, or develop as needed. Bug fixes branch directly from release branch with branch names as `fix/<issue_description>`. Always rebase the local branches off origin as necessary as a way to smooth merge requests to reduce merge conflict across contributors.

Regular communication among collaborators will reduce conflict across contributors that improves developer satisfaction and productivity as contributors learn to better communicate to improve workflow as a result and with less friction, across team members without needing to worry and resolve any merge and conflict situations.




# Review Process

The team maintainers thoroughly review all PRs submitted to guarantee that all contributions adhere to project requirements for coding conventions, security practices and overall design consistency

Review comments carefully respond promptly, and incorporate suggestions if deemed reasonable.  The PR is accepted only after passing all quality reviews by multiple developers across all aspects for functionality to reduce errors, improve performance, as an end effort before releasing a merge! The maintainer then applies merge request after code and tests meet standards of production release, to maintain code stability for all stakeholders!

PR merge will require a code signing and approval to enable it's seamless release for end consumer as an overall commitment from developers, as they sign and take legal liability, so maintain consistency across all aspects as well!



# Communication Channels

Join our community discussion group and sign up as members and get started. Feel free to post or send direct inquiries and feedback regarding issues, suggestions or anything you'd like, at `[Insert Community Communication Channels/Slack Links Here]`! This provides direct feedback for development as we strive toward continuous quality and growth.

You may post messages regarding project's contribution processes to GitHub Discussions, so be active in community discussions for better project awareness and development and feel at ease with any concerns regarding contributions. This helps foster communication for contributors from across all aspects as an overall benefit, as contributors learn from and help shape each other!

If the team can assist and you want direct help and/or clarifications you are encouraged to tag and/or contact one of maintainers on [github username link or any appropriate channels/emails], so maintain consistent communication across various aspects across teams. 



# Security and Responsible Disclosure

If you find a security vulnerability in our code or in the platform the application utilizes for operations do *not* share publicly before giving time for team developers resolve it as they prioritize this.

Contact our security team at `security@ourproject.com`. Be clear with steps needed, affected areas for a timely fix that prevents exploits for potential consumers that could use code! The responsible team would respond within 48hrs with a status update for developers, and they should provide timely feedback across stakeholders for security awareness!

Rapid security patches can improve security for developers that allows seamless and stable development for end customers and maintain the brand name for the company. It improves customer perception by exposing and resolving any potential flaws, that could affect their data, or security, and allow for better adoption of code by external partners as we strive for overall success in all our projects and operations. 



# Release Process

Our code goes into staging as it's released, so all contributing team members are aware to maintain and review for code integrity, security, quality assurance, so it is tested on different platforms as necessary as they move toward full releases of project

New versions/releases prepared when the main repository reaches the threshold of features. New features that require major changes require the new branch that goes directly for the next release. Versioning utilizes the semantics, to improve compatibility and reduce any surprises from end developers. 

Releases will be documented as the latest releases on GitHub and/or documentation websites as a means to inform consumers (users of projects code and its documentation), that will enable consumers better understand code and improve overall experience of code across different environments to facilitate better usage overall to ensure smooth transitions to avoid conflicts, and/or issues, across the entire user landscape for the project!




# Recognition

Our ultimate recognition involves the contributor name in all commits in the main code repositories to give recognition alongside any changes or code they have provided to enable growth in our community. The name can further extend with badges to acknowledge various contributors in public spaces for all the work they do!

The maintainers can provide credits on a website, blog post/documentation to individually mention their specific impact across project to further enhance the recognition. Contributors get to showcase and build up reputation within this space, by improving their profile for the world and potential clients as it improves the community, overall

All team and/or external developers who contribute are recognized with a public mention for the work and impact of the project upon successful and stable code deployment! 



# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributions that come along from outside organization, need CLA (Contribute License Agreement), in order to secure legal protections across both organization for all developers who submit their code! 

The legal document allows us legal usage across contributors code across open sources for commercial or non-commercial use, that ensures both the company contributors are legally compliant! It is necessary, so maintain project integrity and ensure smooth operations, for contributors, organizations involved, to allow them a better sense of peace for any work that contributes into code base as the company expands

Please refer [Contributory License Agreement link to CLA - legal team review], for further documentation, or to ask questions. Please be sure all contributions are accompanied to maintain project legality for our contributors involved with open-source creations, in an everchanging world!



# Resources and References

We have several useful external websites as links, that may prove insightful during your journey into code contribution as a developer. This improves potential contributors understanding on proper workflows across our organization, to help streamline onboarding for everyone.

Consult Python `PEP 8` to follow proper and best Python formatting practices, for better code maintainability, from all stakeholders and to reduce any future readability/compatibility challenges across contributors to the code as project evolves. Refer this resource [PEP8 Style Guide], and utilize automated tooling that enables simplification!
