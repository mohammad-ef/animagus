 ## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You should have Git and a local repository of the project installed on your computing setup. We utilize a common development flow for managing code updates & improvements so understanding these steps will streamline collaboration. Make certain you are familiar with using a code editor.

### Branch Creation

Before making contributions, start from an appropriate branching system from main. Use this to prevent any issues from interfering your main project version during development. The name should clearly reflect your intended purpose for this particular feature branch.. 

Create a new branch with a name indicating the purpose like 'feature/my-new functionality' using the command  `git chek cout --b feature/my -new -functionality.` This ensures the changes will impact development in an organized manner..

  ### Environment & Installation Setup
To start developing with the project you'll need a few tools to ensure that it all runs as expected. Install Python >=3.9 with pip as an environment dependency.. Then install any other dependencies needed via: `pip install --req-file requirements.txt`. After installation verify the setup.  Run `python main script`.

### Building the Code 

To confirm that installation was done successfully build the software by executing the `build command` which could be  `pip  install -r requirements`.txt`. This ensures any needed external resources have properly loaded. If this returns any unexpected output check the dependency file. This ensures any needed extern resources were properly set-up..  The command ensures that dependencies and tools load as anticipated and that they can all interact as planned in an organized fashion.

  ### Basic Workflow

After installing your environment and setup, pull the project to update any existing changes. Start by checking out a fresh branch with descriptive names like `feature-login` from the `develop or `main branch to avoid affecting core code while you develop.  Push your new commits after completing your development tasks with  ` git remote origin`..

## How to Submitt a Pull Reequests (PR) 

### Branching Guidelines 

To start with always branch from either `main`or `develop` to keep changes separated. Create names with `feature` or `fix` preficies to easily distinguish purpose. `feature/new-button -component`, `fix /login -issue` are good branch titles.

### Commit Style 
Commit messages need clear concise descriptions explaining the reason behind the updates that were made during development.. Commit descriptions assist with understanding the code base and reviewing changes effectively. We believe collaboration is an effective development process.
