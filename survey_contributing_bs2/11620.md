# CONTRIBUITING. MD for the "Example Project"


Welcome! This repository powers our open 'Example Project,' a tool designed [describe the tool concisely, one to  four line explanation]. We greatly appreciate any contributions made to our open source tool. Contributing enhances project usability, improves reliability and helps expand it in unexpected ways to solve a multitude of issues

This project is intended not just to improve a code repository but, to build an inviting community and to create the conditions so contributors of varied experience are supported in making impactful changes to 'Example Project' This process requires us to create inclusive processes that ensure our project welcomes everyone who can contribute to the open community

Both small improvements (typos in the docstring) or big feature enhancements (complex algorithm changes)  are extremely helpful. We welcome any form that improves or grows our open source offering to a better solution for the world. We encourage you contribute with your unique experiences or to learn new ones with our welcoming team of experts! 	

**Code of Conduct**	
Our values revolve on mutual kindness in an open, honest and safe community. Respect for each individual and all contributions, is a key value that guides how all interactions should work in the community. Please respect the code when interacting with team members in this project

We commit that every member must treat other with respect, including those of varied backgrounds and abilities. We value diverse viewpoints to solve the most pressing and interesting of problems for our community. This commitment requires all contributors be aware to ensure inclusivity.

Any behavior that harasses, insults, degrades others in our open source community are not welcomed here nor tolerated by this maintainer or contributor team. We take our commitment to inclusivity extremely seriously in building a community for everyone to enjoy in an equal way. Violatios will trigger swift consequences from project leaders to maintain our culture. 

## Getting Started

First things foremost, make absolutely certain to have `Git v2.15` installed as well and working.  You can check that with running command: `git-- version` in an active command terminal. We also use [Package Manger Name] which must be installed for the build tool dependencies in your terminal

Create your for of `Git Repo` from your machine using standard procedure. You can copy `Git Repo Link`, paste that into you preferred terminal to clone a working copy of version. If not, we suggest using your favorite IDE which will handle all steps. 

Before starting with local build, make certain install dependencies to run code in our open repository using standard installation steps, `package manager install --dependencies from package-json `. The above commands should install all necessary code in a way that will run and test on our open source offering.

Next, create a virtual environment with your `preferred tool`. After creating your environment install dependencies with the above command, so our build runs with minimal issues in any machine with standard tools installed to work the project' code .

Build code and ensure everything compiles by executing standard building commands. If errors happen, please read error and make sure all tools are installed, or there is no conflicts between the versions in machine that is running build steps. 	

## Contributing

We want to see all of 'Example Project', grow to the fullest in an inclusive and welcoming environment. This process requires everyone who participates contribute code, test it and improve it to the open source tool

Consider suggesting feature changes before implementing any changes to ensure the community and maintain team are fully onboard, before any code change are merged in the repository version. Open source success happens when we build on collective ideas that we discuss, plan and improve. This collaborative spirit builds great solutions! 

We are open to suggestions for documentation, improvements and other ways contributors can improve our tool or build community around 'Example Project'. All feedback or suggestions for improvements is welcome and greatly appreciated!  

When submitting issues, provide detailed reproduction steps and environment information. It helps tremendously to debug or to see your suggestion implemented faster. If we all work to improve the project, we're more capable to create great features that benefit a wide userbase.

When suggesting changes to existing features, provide context or justification. Why do existing feature need improvement? Why would this change solve a problem? What are alternatives considered that we did not take? We need a lot of transparency and collaboration to ensure the highest standard in our open offering!

## Report Bugs
Please create issues using [GitHub Issues link]. Provide as specific and reproducible of information possible. If we do understand the problem well in our own environment, this greatly increase chance for solving bug.  

Include detailed descriptions and error messages when filing issue. Include the versions of any related software used and steps needed to reproduce the problem, so it will not be lost! If the problem is complex, provide a minimum viable reproduction.

A small, reproducible example helps immensely. Ideally, a minimal code sample that exhibits the bug without external dependencies makes debugging far easier. This allows maintainers to understand issue and test it effectively without much work needed from their side.	 

Ensure the bug isn' have duplicate report. Check open issues for already-reported problems similar issue with existing ones. Duplicate issues clog the issue tracker, so avoid it as you can to ensure the bug is resolved quickly and efficiently. We need everyone's focus! 

Finally, before submitting bug report, make sure the bug isn' actually a configuration issue or an expected behaviour. Check project documentation or FAQs and make sure there' isn' something simple we are missing to understand expected result for a task we are executing.

 ## Suggest Enhancements
Pro pose any feature enhancement, by opening GitHub issues and provide a detailed description. Clearly outline the proposed enhancements benefits to our open source project

Describe the motivation behind enhancement request. What user problems would solve? What are specific user scenarios and benefits to the open offering and user community? A detailed proposal increases our team to quickly understand request to solve it quickly.	

We evaluate enhancement proposal on feasibility impact to our open code and alignment existing strategy and architecture. Prioritization of the enhancement requests happen after careful review of the proposals.  

When describing the enhancement, consider any existing approaches considered. What were their trade- offs and why did not meet your needs, if the approach does not solve the needs? This shows the team your thought process and builds more confidence on the proposal.

## Pull Requests 

Before creating PR, make it a habit to `git fetch origin` and merge latest code changes using `git rebase origin/main`. The re base command keeps your code aligned the latest code and helps avoid conflicts when PR submitted in code.

Always create new feature branches from `main`. Feature should be named appropriately such as `feature-example or bug-name `. Using standardized convention helps team understand purpose and location of the changes when we are code review.

Write concise, self-contained PRs focusing single change. Large, monolithic PRs are hard review and can delay code merging. Smaller changes enable easier reviews and reduces the risk of introducing bugs.	

Ensure code meets all defined coding standards. The coding standard are described later, in a coding standard document, where we define the formatting guidelines used to build our open source tool. The PR won' merge, it is in disagreement to defined standards. 

Test the changes before PR and create unit/integration tests to ensure new functionality works as expected and existing code remains intact. The test code helps the maintain team build confidence in the quality of code changes that we merge in code!	 

## Coding Standards

Adher to PEP8 guidelines and project-specific code conventions. Ensure indentation is standard 4- spaces using the preferred Python editor tool. We want all of contributors write clean and easy maintainable and understandable to the open code base

Variable name use `snake_case` format while function should use `camelCase format for code to improve readability and consistency. We use `flake 8` for linting and `myp y` or type checking. Ensure to run them on a local machine. 

Code documentation is crucial. Write clear and concise docstrings explaining code functions, arguments and return of any functions. Document the purpose of code and the reasoning to help other users understand purpose.

Consistent formatting is a key part code standards.  Use `black`, to automatic code code and ensure it adheres project standards. We enforce the standard with a code formatting check that we run when we merge changes. 

Avoid code repetition or complex structures to improve readability and reduce complexity code. Keep things clean and easy to follow, which allows others maintain it in open community!

## Test Guidlines

Write test for every new code changes. Ensure to use test driven development for all new code written. If we all work to improve the project, we're more capable to create great features that benefit a wide userbase.

Use the existing unit- test framework [Name] in testing. If not, we suggest you to create new tests. Create tests with proper documentation that describe its intended behaviour. 

Cover edge conditions and exceptional scenarios in tests. Think about unusual situations when writing new tests.  

Test existing implementation before merging new code in the repository to prevent regressions or unexpected errors. We want all users enjoy our open source product.

##  Documentation Contributions

Enhance existing documentation or contribute new documentation where it is needed. Ensure your writing to meet the existing standards. 	

Documentation stored under the `/ docs/` directory and should follow `reStructuredText format`.  Use proper formatting and consistent voice.

Make sure to build documentation locally, by running `make html`, before merging PR with the project.  

All changes must be clearly and concisely. We welcome any improvements in our open offering!

## Commitment Message Guidelines

Write meaningful commit message using proper format such as `type(scope): subject`. Follow commit messages standards.	

Type is the classification such `feat`, `bug or `docs`. Scope defines code or project section affected change like `login`, `auth` or `user-settings `.
	

Subject is a short and concise description what changed. Write the subject in imperative present to convey the changes made clearly.
  

Write more detail explanation after `subject line`. The description must be concise and provide additional detail about the changes made in the commit.

Ensure commit messages are clear concise and well written. This is important for future code maintenance and helps to understand the history changes to open- source product.

## Branch Models

Project uses `GitFlow branching model`, so ensure you are aware to create the correct branches when contributing.

Create feature branches from `develop` branch. This will allow multiple features development without affecting production branch.

Merge features to release/ hotfix after feature testing and review is over. Release and hotfix branches created off `develop branch`.

## Reviews Process

Maintainers thoroughly reviews and test code. Review includes functionality testing, performance, code style and potential side effects.

Feedback given will be clear constructive. Maintainers provides specific recommendations and improvements code, or suggest additional tests.

Pull requests approved after all reviews and tests are passed with a code merge. If there is a problem, we are here to discuss!
