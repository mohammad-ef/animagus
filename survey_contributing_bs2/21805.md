# CONTRIBUTING#
  
 Welcome! We are glad we are glad that you're interested in contributing to this project. Contributions, whether technical or otherwise, are vital as the foundation on which we continue to grow and build upon our project' s success. We value any effort that helps us to make our project more efficient or better for the wider public!

  We encourage contributions from community developers with varied experience, and appreciate everyone taking time to engage with our project. No effort is too small. Your feedback, insights from using our project, or bug fixes contribute directly to a stronger overall product. 

  This guide outlines the procedures you will need while participating in our community. It aims to make contributing as streamlined and easy to understand possible, and we are grateful for the effort you dedicate to our project.

## Code of Conduct

  We are committed to foster a warm, safe, and friendly community for everyone. We value all contributors, and we expect everyone to interact respectfully and constructively. Please be mindful of your words and conduct to ensure a welcoming environment for all participants. 

  This means being respectful of differing opinions, refraining from personal attacks, and actively seeking to understand alternative viewpoints.  Constructive criticism is welcome, but delivered with empathy and professionalism. Harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior will not be tolerated and may lead to a ban from the community.

  To ensure a positive and inclusive experience for all, we adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). You are expected to review and abide by this code. Violations will result in removal from project involvement and possible notification to appropriate authorities if the behavior constitutes illegal actions.

## Getting Started

 First, ensure you have the necessary tools: Git is mandatory for version control, and a suitable programming language environment (as specified in our README) is crucial for local development and debugging purposes. Make it a priority to have the correct versions and packages installed.  

Next to begin, fork the repository on GitHub. This creates a copy of the project under your account, allowing you to work on changes independently. Afterwards, clone your forked repository to your local machine, so you have the necessary files accessible for development and debugging locally.

Once forked and cloned, create a new branch for your work, following our branching guidelines (detailed later). Avoid working directly on the `main` branch! It keeps changes well structured and avoids potential conflict or merge issues, ensuring smooth integration back into the codebase.

 Install any dependencies outlined in the `README.md` or setup guides provided with our project (such as `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`). Build the project following our setup steps to verify your environment and the codebase is running successfully locally before contributing!

  The `README.md` usually provides more information, or consult `INSTALL.md` within the repository to help navigate our initial build instructions. This should include all necessary commands and configurations that may assist new developers. If these files donot provide sufficient detail or you're experiencing difficulties setting up our software project you can visit the "Communication Channels" listed in this file!

Finally, run all the tests, if our project comes equipped with them, so we are guaranteed we aren 't inadvertently damaging current working code. We use this lifecycle when testing to avoid breaking changes and to improve overall quality in every build process!

## How to Contribute

There are multiple ways you can help enhance our project, from simple tasks to more comprehensive contributions. If something seems to be missing, a feature you desire, or if the product has a problem with functionality feel free to report these issues to the team and provide valuable data so that they may address and alleviate problems for other community users.

You can suggest features or improvements even without contributing code directly. We value community feedback for identifying opportunities. Submit these using GitHub Discussions (see communication section below), clearly articulating the motivation and intended benefits, and how this will help others benefit or address current pain-points with current product usage.

If you have the programming expertise and interest in extending this functionality we strongly recommend submitting code! Submitting patches demonstrates commitment, builds a sense of belonging with current members, and improves functionality with our code as new developers help contribute fixes or build improvements to this code repository.

Don 't overlook the impact of contributing to the documentation. Accurate, comprehensive documentation benefits all users and can improve the ease-of-use significantly for newcomers. This could entail adding a section about our project or fixing existing bugs in existing code comments/ documentation, which would improve our overall clarity with current product use.

Before implementing substantial changes, open an issue or start a discussion. Early engagement allows you to gain clarity, ensure the direction aligns with the project's goals, and prevents duplication of efforts by you or your co-contributors to help make improvements on it overall. 

We need contributors for a wide range of activities! Don't worry if your experience is not in direct development: there are plenty of things for you to work with to provide feedback as you go and help the process along! 

## Reporting Bugs

 To help us diagnose and resolve bugs quickly, it will assist with the creation of well formed reproducible reports when issues occur and they should have these components. The better you report, the easier we can find, address, and eliminate problems from affecting future versions!

First, search the existing issues to make sure it doesn&#x27;t already exist, preventing unnecessary duplicate issues for our team members. Then describe the steps necessary to consistently create this error so it occurs again, consistently for testing, debugging and eventual release updates with fixes for issues discovered with your input. 

Next to provide details: the steps to reproduce are very useful and are essential. Alongside this provide a clear, accurate description of what happened: explain the observed behaviour against what should be happening and describe its consequences for current users, so we get the best insight possible for a fix and resolution on our side!

Include environment details. Operating system, version of relevant software or packages are crucial details that help identify and isolate issues across varying configurations of our codebase to find commonalities with reported bugs for a faster solution overall for current community contributors. 

 Finally, report any errors that appear with error logs that are produced with each crash. This can contain crucial debugging code snippets. We track bugs and enhancement suggestions via GitHub Issues [here](https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_ORG>/<YOUR_PROJECT>/issues). Be sure to follow the provided issue template carefully, it will guide you toward a clear format!

## Suggesting Enhancements

To contribute enhancements, it 's best practice is to first propose these improvements by submitting a new GitHub issue describing it as well as a possible scope or solution with its impact assessment of implementation of such feature on the codebase itself

Clearly, provide rationale with motivation behind enhancement request as well: describe your reasons why enhancement needed and describe the value for existing community, future consumers with the enhancement, with an understanding to improve existing processes with the project.  The better justification we are presented with on a suggestion is a greater likely it receives a higher ranking for implementation with existing priorities for our codebase maintenance and enhancement schedule!

Outline intended use cases. Explain clearly and explicitly the intended purpose for new additions or updates so we better gauge and prioritize its potential implementation within scope to current and near-future release goals, for a clear scope-based plan for development to avoid overextending ourselves as maintainers in an unmanageable workload of code to develop for release

Maintenance and our developers assess suggested features for relevance, technical feasibility, and impact on existing system. Prioritization is based on multiple parameters - user demand, complexity, resource cost and alignment of feature requests. Our current their assessment process will ensure the product's roadmap and strategic direction will stay intact. 

 Critically important: remember we want as clear as a definition for these feature enhancement requirements for a faster, and less complicated process to assess feasibility for potential future incorporation of our product roadmap, with all relevant metrics. 

## Pull Request Process

 The primary method for incorporating changes to our codebase into the repository involves opening and then merging the respective Pull Requests into our project! Please take note that these Pull Requests require review prior to be approved by maintainers of the existing product implementation! 

Create a new branch: Always use your dedicated working branches so the main working repository will be unaffected! To create, start using our existing `main` (or designated "develop") as source with `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`. Replace 'my-feature' by name that accurately and briefly conveys its objective or nature of your contributions.  

  Write clear and concise commits! Make frequent small, focused commits with well written commit messages to clearly convey intention to reviewers with an audit-capable process to trace history and changes of all contributions for future development purposes as we grow with contributors and community needs. We require all of commits should adhere with standard formatting as outlined later with a standardized and structured commitment. 

 Ensure the new code works:  Verify functionality with tests to guarantee no existing behavior broken and no regression errors caused from new implementation contribution with automated and manually tested validation of the implementation! It helps avoid issues from surfacing into existing user experiences that will need a future rework!

Create Pull Request with details. Submit new pull request by using your created and working working code repository from GitHub and follow the templates we require. Be sure include an explicit title to summarize change as clearly, briefly and concise manner. All applicable changes need be outlined for reviewers for clarity with implementation!

Code review process occurs, followed testing with automated checks, before code will be integrated. Expect review questions. Engage promptly, address any requested edits. Maintainer's feedback guides improvement with iterative changes, with the aim for final merge to the main/release code-stream once satisfactory to our requirements of quality assurance testing and development!

## Coding Standards

Maintain consistency through following guidelines and coding style as a standard to ensure the project remains maintainable and clean across all developer contribution! This standard should extend and include all code contribution with this product from all contributors

Indentation style needs to remain standard across code, and typically uses `2 spaces` with the `no tabulations`, to help with overall maintainability, cleanliness and overall structure. This uniformity makes debugging simpler with the consistent layout and easier readability.  
   

 Naming is the core foundation and is crucial in ensuring code comprehension as a primary development goal! All naming variables should utilize `snake_case`, with descriptive names that indicate its intended meaning/role of variables to enhance maintainability for future modifications or enhancements to project codebase. This helps ensure readability.

 We adhere strict style guidelines using an automatic formatter to help keep coding structure. The configuration for our code formatter and style guidelines resides under `.eslintrc.js` which can serve and refer our developers on standards of coding style within all project contributions as part of our automated process checks during review for Pull Requests for integration purposes into project release cycles.

 All code and new code contributions require comprehensive JSDoc comments for proper clarity and explanation to future contributors who will be auditing the implementation or extending it later on to build future functionality or maintain current state! This documentation will help reduce the cognitive overhead and streamline our debugging efforts. 

 We employ `TypeScript` for static analysis as another standard with the intention that the team should strive towards utilizing `types` for enhanced reliability within codebase to reduce unexpected error or implementation flaws as well with a cleaner structure and implementation. This will reduce bugs!

## Testing Guidelines

Ensure new or altered feature implementations are validated using comprehensive unit test frameworks. Unit Tests ensure individual function or object implementations perform as defined for our intended scope!

Our product leverages Mocha testing frameworks. Refer documentation on Mocha and the existing testing code for guidance with testing. This framework should have sufficient support from current contributors so it can continue being expanded on. This framework can support both automated test running or combination for more holistic debugging

Existing test suite is accessible in a given path and must also adhere and align itself as part of testing and contribution standards for Pull Requests to integrate! It is expected that you execute this testing framework with existing unit code tests for validation as new implementations or contributions. We encourage writing integration, performance regression, edge, happy and error cases. These will provide holistic test validation coverage and will ensure that we do have proper safeguards. 

Coverage metrics must pass at 90%, as it is our minimum baseline coverage. If your contribution introduces a new module that cannot pass baseline, then please create an automated integration tests and/or documentation so our product remains robust to new disregards on our coverage and quality metrics, for continuous quality!  
## Documentation Contributions

  Improve project comprehension. Ensure documentation stays concise with accuracy and clarity as well. Any contributions to this space help reduce ambiguity to new user-base! Documentation lives within this root `docs` directory within the source codebase. All edits must maintain clarity, conciseness to avoid misunderstandings!

Update outdated information with accuracy for existing user and consumer. This helps provide more accurate, updated guidance so consumers are up-to-date about new changes that can impact the user. 

  Existing documentation is generated as `Markdown` and uses our configured documentation build pipeline and system that can generate user and development references, API guides or tutorials to support the development team, user communities, or new consumer adoption

 We value any contribution in documentation - adding examples for use and extending our product capabilities for the greater use and benefit of all consumers of product implementation with its current scope of usage with current implementation guidelines to guide future product ennancements.

## Commit Message Guidelines

 We adhere with `Conventional Commits`. Use standardized commit style. Each line within our codebase is traceable to an intent.

Commit Message structure. Each message must contain an informative and succinct subject, followed with blank space and then more detailed and explanation for implementation for maintainability! 

Use the appropriate scope prefixes! `feat:` for newly introducing, and enhancing, new functions and capabilities for the overall system. We will require the same format when submitting bug patches for `fix`. For other things: Use scope of component being changed to enhance traceability! If not specified `docs:`, or other applicable category to indicate purpose for contribution!
  
 Commit must have detailed information: Describe context behind code, reasoning and purpose! Explain why the contribution matters with details and potential issues/challenges it may face for the team! The details needs assist developers assist and debug in current future and upcoming iterations and fundamentals with our codebase for maintenance
 We value concise, clean commitment standards with consistent style so the product history remains maintainable, debuggable with ease to understand a prior contributor intentions!
## Branching Model

 We adopt and employ [Gitflow Branching Model](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/guide/gitflow/), for organized feature development. This helps with organized development, staging for testing with our existing testing infrastructure before releasing to secondary/ production releases
 We recommend `main` as stable. Only merges of `released` should be allowed! All code contributions go onto feature/hotfix branches to ensure the primary repository does not contain code undergoing change!

*Create branch for development:  When starting any new work on project features use a branch from `main`, following format `feature/<feature_name>`

When bug patches must go onto dedicated working feature to isolate the patch.  Create branches using format such as: `fix/<short-explanation> ` that allows maintainers better track bug issues to resolve them as needed! For hot-fix situations when a quick hot-fix for a product issue is identified then you must create and work off dedicated release-branch that isolates fixes with minimal risk. This is the release hot-fix strategy

 We will enforce the branch standards to improve workflow with code management and prevent issues with main release! Any failure on the standard will be subject to a pull reject!



## Review Process

 We use code reviews. Before merging contributions into any of stable working stream we enforce that pull requests are subjected with comprehensive assessment with code reviewers with the intent on identifying potential issues/errors/ or inconsistencies and to improve overall implementation

 Maintainers may suggest edits/modifications for code improvements or to conform our coding conventions, or even testability of current working functionality of our features with our automated tests or manual verification tests. Please be receptive, address any suggestions in timely manners with clear responses/reasoning

 Expect follow-up review requests after modifications for code. It may happen as many follow up reviews to fully vet code and to improve our codebase for overall robustness!

## Communication Channels

  For discussions with community. Engage through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_ORG>/<YOUR_PROJECT>/discussions), as we have it setup to foster communication, share suggestions or seek advice about any aspect within codebase and functionality
 If critical assistance/ support, we use a discord. Link will available from the [link provided at the readme](insert Link of existing support/Discord channels if possible).
  GitHub issue is our formal system to report any and all problems!

  Be professional with our community to encourage and build relationships to support overall community goals to ensure our overall community remains positive

## Security and Responsible Disclosure

 We care deeply and want assets secure for consumers with product implementations with existing product usage with future enhancements with existing infrastructure to safeguard against external or internal threat vulnerabilities 
 If potential for vulnerability exists within our codebase and we encourage you to immediately alert to a team member with sensitive reporting and confidential nature to address and prevent exposure with external parties 
 Never publish security details to open forums and instead follow responsible security guidelines for handling security-disclosure with appropriate reporting protocols!


## Release Process

 Release happens after successful code-review/validation with comprehensive testing. Tag versioning is a key step that follows after the testing cycle

 Changelog documentation is automatically updated with all features enhancements to track the progress from prior release and for documentation and awareness. We adhere with our `Semantic Versioning Standard` for our versions for incremental enhancements

 Automated deployment to secondary servers happens automatically for verification testing of our current implementation! This is for our product release testing before final deployment of the current codebase.



## Recognition
