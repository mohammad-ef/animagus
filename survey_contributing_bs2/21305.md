## 2. GETTING STARTED

 To get started with contributing, you'll need a Git installation set up on your system. Make sure you have Git installed and configured properly with your username and email.  Instructions for installation and setup can be found on the [Git Documentation Website, insert a link].

 Fork this repository into your own account. This creates a local copy that you can modify and push changes to. Create a new branch off the `main` branch for your changes (more on branching later).

 Once this is completed, follow the installation steps provided below to setup the required dependencies and configure the build enviroment:

```bash
   git clone git@github.com:[your_user]/[Project_name].git # Clones the forked repository.
   cd [Project_ name ] # Navigates to the cloned folder of the project.
   npm install # Installs the necessary dependencies for the project (adjust to your project language - yarn, pip, etc.).
   npm run build # Builds the local version - if applicable
```

 Now the project is ready to be developed. If you're encountering problems with the build or dependencies installation, please reach out to the maintainers for further assistance.

## 3. HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

 We welcome a variety of ways you can contribute to our project. These include finding and reporting bugs or issues, suggesting ideas for new features and improvements, writing clear and concise documentation, or submitting changes through Pull Requests (PR s).

 Before diving into any coding, it is helpful to discuss the proposed changes with the project maintainer(s). This helps avoid potential conflicts and ensures we align on the overall goals for the project. This discussion can take place on the issues section, our discussion board, or other communication platforms outlined further in this document.

 If your goal is submitting pull requests (PRs) to add or improve existing functionalities, follow our guidelines and code style (covered in further sections of this guide). PRs with well written commits will significantly expedite the code review process.

  Documentation and testing, although perhaps lesser recognized contributions, can be equally useful. Updating the README files to make installation easier, improving example files and contributing automated tests helps other users get a good and smooth user-experience while improving overall maintainability of the product.

 Contributing to a team or product often is an exciting adventure; and it is an incredible opportunity for collaboration with skilled experts who want to produce something of value!  If this opportunity sounds enticing for you, feel free and reach out before making substantial alterations in a PR - your insights could significantly benefit everyone else working with us on this exciting product.

## 4. REPORTING BUGS

  Whenever you come across a bug during the use of the product or during code exploration and discovery, you can help others in this group as well, through proper issue filing practices! This process involves identifying steps which reproduce and consistently show-case this bug.

 To help the project quickly address issues, we kindly ask to follow our reporting procedure when reporting issues - create a detailed description and try and isolate and replicate bug to be sure of accurate reproduction!

 The bug should have these items in it:  A detailed and informative description that is easy to follow. What did you *expect* to happen and what actually happened, along with steps you performed prior, that led you to experience the failure? 

 A minimum, reproducible example (MRE). If there's possible data involved (databases), provide a simple data-example or a way to reproduce it without access to production. A good reproducible code block or data is very important! This can involve simplified scripts for reproduction or even dummy configurations files, which help others debug.  All of the data, files and configuration needed can assist maintainers reproduce and quickly resolve this reported issues!

 We strongly suggest utilizing the 'Issues' on the project Github Repo page (https://github.com/[username]/[Project name]/issues ) since we have configured it with a tracking system that helps prioritize issues and track fixes effectively and in real time.

## 5. SUGGESTING ENHANCEMENTS

 If you've discovered that the project lacks certain improvements, or would benefit from some features enhancements, then do suggest suitable and helpful suggestions! The process to follow when reporting new enhancements can follow our standard protocol - provide detailed motivation and potential scenarios!

 Please provide details and reasons as to why you're requesting this change - explain use cases, and potential problems that will arise when it won not occur and who is benefitting! Providing the use case for an idea allows other team members evaluate if a proposed suggestion would align well within current development priorities or be more aligned towards longer development projects. 

 Maintainers review these proposals with consideration and based on project needs, priorities and resources - it might need discussion within the whole team and it's possible your suggestions gets rejected, delayed or incorporated at the time you expected! Don 't despair though as the project can still be benefited in future, or it can even influence new project developments.

  If you can, create a design document with potential mock-ups of how new features could be introduced to ensure it aligns and complements well current project goals - a simple document, can make it clear for reviewers. 

 We appreciate you thinking critically of our system, offering ideas of enhancements, so it is always helpful if they include mock-ups that provide context on why this change could assist the users.   If these enhancements get incorporated to existing codebase you can claim your contributor name and celebrate your work and your efforts towards contributing into open-source world!

## 6. PULL REQUEST PROCESS

 Contributing changes by submitting pull requests is a key method used. Please create new branch, commit changes that adhere and address specific task or bug that aligns the new version to the requirements - it will assist and expedite code review for team.

 Always name the new branch to clearly describe change that branch will perform; examples: 'feature/my-awesome-feature', 'fix/typo-spelling' and follow standard convention (branch_type/branch_identifier). Before you start making the pull requests you have a great tool, that's the communication and discussing potential alterations with project's lead and stakeholders; this prevents code divergence or unexpected behaviors later.

 We request you follow these simple requirements to ensure a successful pull request: Include a detailed and comprehensive PR Description outlining all changes implemented and potential effects - a description assists team to better follow through code reviews for potential improvements to existing code.
 Make changes aligned within the coding convention - we expect the code base remains uniform across changes. 
 Make the necessary code updates or add tests for new additions/modifications in the product and adhere and maintain a uniform code structure for all contributors and ensure consistent formatting standards are being observed and adhered throughout entire code review and development cycles for new features - these practices helps prevent future problems when making scaling and maintainance.

 When PR submitted we follow through an automatic test, review, testing procedure where code and new tests run through the test-cycle for validation purposes to avoid breaking existing components, or new bugs introduced into product codebases. 
 Once all the test cases passes the PR is submitted to maintainers and team lead members who do code reviews before being approved to be pushed. The review can contain additional questions about approach or suggestions that will improve your contributions, feel free to communicate, as these contributions will make all users' journey to success and will contribute to better project quality

## 7. CODING STANDARDS

 Maintain the code clean - a well organized project helps others understand how components works. Therefore it helps maintain a sustainable system that grows well across contributors to improve project and reduce overall project development cycles

 Our coding style must remain the same - consistent coding standard will reduce cognitive burden while code scanning, reviewing or testing. Use 4 spaces instead of a tab and maintain maximum lines for function, which should have not longer than ~80 symbols, with short descriptive naming to ensure the readability across all team. 

 Consider linting tools for automatic enforcement style rules such as Prettier to automatically adjust the project. This reduces human mistakes or inconsistencies and ensure uniformity of the coding styles within the code - and allows contributors and users understand what's going to be delivered at the moment they access project code and features
  We strongly prefer Typescript for projects as its strict typing will reduce the chances of introducing type-related errors while reviewing, or contributing into project features! If it's another technology we require to maintain and document type signatures to avoid type-based-error while integrating different pieces in our system

---

## 8. TESTING GUIDELINES

 Automated testing, and especially continuous-integration testing will allow to deliver and validate code and features much more efficiently with much higher confidence of success and reliability - therefore ensure we have tests! Ensure to include all edge cases in our product - it can improve our users confidence in using a well maintained product
 Before you commit new features to product, we ask for new features/alterations/refactoring must go alongside automated and robust unit and integration tests. This way team knows and validates new code will align requirements while also preventing bugs and future unexpected errors - a small effort that pays out much later and will save many cycles

 Ensure all code that's modified is covered with a proper test cases. If you can provide integration tests as an added validation to new feature - we strongly welcome such contributions! This ensures integration works smoothly and organically without creating additional conflicts

 The automated testing is usually run via our Github actions - if you can not access Github, we encourage the tests run in your local enviroment - you may find a test running scripts within the product that's designed and configured within each language! This helps team ensure we are always in good code standing

## 9. DOCUMENTATION CONTRIBUTIONS

 Well organized, well explained docs - these help new members quickly onboard, understand existing code, contribute into it - or to assist in onboarding of future users. If docs isn`t well structured, the whole product might not succeed - users can abandon if the project  lacks clarity - it might lead the user-journey in confusion instead a smooth transition 

 Project`s Docs resides within a specific folders (check the `doc` subfolder or the README) where it stores documentation that's accessible via a web page - if this feature is enabled. It helps new and existing contributors find relevant documentation and quickly learn new functionalities and protocols to onboard. 

 If a feature has complex usage - we require to maintain updated, well described tutorials. We encourage maintain and improve consistency throughout existing documentation while improving readability, removing outdated information - and keeping up all current standards and guidelines that were previously mentioned and established

 If your goal isn adding docs and not just edits/improvements, make it accessible. This can come in form with clear titles with proper headers and descriptions to make sure that users understand content immediately.  Consider providing clear diagrams, charts for visual learners - which assists and helps understanding more intuitively! 

---

## 10. COMMIT MESSAGE GUIDELINES

 Consistent, well formatted commit history is critical - mostly due to team size increases, a clean and well organized commit log, will assist in identifying what was done. Commit titles must not exceed the limit of ~50 symbols and follow specific conventional standards - these ensure we can automatically parse what's done via our release tools
   The format to be adhered by, when writing our messages are : type(scope?): description
     Where `type` represents category for kind of contribution like feature/bug/fix, docs, styling, etc.  Scope refers specific areas/feature that's involved with these modifications, it is completely optional though but assists with identifying affected regions within codebase and it allows team members find specific information much more accurately
     Descriptions needs clear, concize message that accurately highlights the goal or purpose. If there any context that might need explaining - include the details efficiently without exceeding line limit and making them easy and intuitive for other members in your group - and completely clear! 

 By implementing these standard guidelines, all contributors benefit. It helps to automatically track the release cycle - it also helps building and maintain the project with much more stability. This helps maintain consistency while improving our workflow across the product development

---

## 11. BRANCHING MODEL

 Project follows [Insert Git branching model - for example - Trunk Based] for its development workflow throughout entire team - which allows rapid iteration for features, fixes for critical bugs. Our model promotes fast releases with short cycle times. We do our code work with new features, enhancements and improvements on their separate feature branch, isolated. This allows developers contribute and merge features, and fix issues independently while avoiding disruption with stable code branch means
 If there are bugs/urgent production fix, the branch name will contain "fix-" as prefixes; If we need new improvements and additional code features it needs "feature-" - it helps identify the nature of these code modifications for better tracking purposes, and it also improves clarity when discussing potential merge conflicts. 

 We strongly advice, before you make significant contributions - it helps with avoiding code merge issues if you first discuss and agree what changes you plan with main development group before committing.

 When ready - make PR - describe and request code-review by senior developers, before it merged back on a `main`.

---

## 12. REVIEW PROCESS

 Every submission undergoes rigorous scrutiny for alignment. Our reviewers assess not only code functionality, but adherence to code conventions while also ensuring quality

 Feedback on a submission will include areas where modifications might be suggested to increase efficiency, security of our code. If you feel you strongly need an explanation or more clarifications - you have all authority ask questions, or provide additional feedback that's useful, to improve team quality across contributors 

 PR merge happens only when team reaches full-code consensus - after code validation - PR will also migrated onto stable release, or testing - branch based around the needs. This entire review system and code process helps with quality while preventing regression in existing codebase to deliver and maintain product for long

---

## 13. COMMUNICATION CHANNELS

 Project has established a range of communications channel and it will greatly enhance communication within project

 You may engage within communication with project via Github issues - you will quickly engage to get responses/feedback/suggestions - which will assist on clearing up issues

 Alternatively project maintainers may have discord server that facilitates communication within contributors. We also can provide email communication if Github is too much.

 The main purpose, however, to assist in clear communications across members, maintain code standards for everyone involved! Feel free ask or discuss issues in these various venues.
 We welcome and encourage you - contribute, and feel at-home in a welcoming and supportive open-source community.
---

## 14. SECURITY AND RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE

 Responsible behavior and reporting vulnerabilities is very vital safety and stability

 Please avoid any disclosure on security problems publicly before they fixed; we need resolve any bugs privately

 When a potential issue or some type-bug, report immediately on a private and direct manner, or via a specific channel for vulnerability reports (security email, secure contact - if provided by group.)

 Our main concern will resolve issues as quick as can to improve safety and reliability of system; if possible you may provide minimal and reproducibly sample code or data. 

 ---

## 15. RELEASE PROCESS

 Releases are typically done at fixed intervals based around product and development team schedule
 Before final deployment into users production - it goes to QA team to run a suite for quality validations that's run to test product
 When testing passes code merged back and new tagged to identify the product versions - and then we make announcement

 If there significant change to the version numbers - that follows our Semantic Versioning approach. The semantic change includes Major (new code breaking changes). Minor(New code enhancements that aren breaking changes to the codebase, etc - Patch: Fix bug, mistranslated or typo) which help with communicating and manage production releases with users

 If there new versions and you want to include a contribution, ensure it gets added - as contributor on Changelog to show that all users appreciate all involved contributions! It will greatly increase user's engagement!
 ---

## 16. RECOGNITION

  Contribution recognition - it motivates team while promoting a welcoming community where team feels value to contribute

 Contributions recognized within product, and project Changelog files that list contributions.

 Additionally all contributor profiles get linked and highlighted to showcase contributions to help build and foster a sense of pride in team!

 It also encourages new potential contributions while promoting community to engage in more development - all while promoting a sense of ownership across everyone!

---

## 17. CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT (CLA)

 Before contributing you may agree, depending upon licensing agreements. It means giving us rights for usage to code

 CLA grants us the necessary license for code contributions that allow for the open-source license features - and modify as appropriate. Please review, sign - before contributing, so team is fully in alignment - which allows us continue increasing project with more open collaboration from team. [Add a link or a CLA file].

  You acknowledge that you fully comprehended all of terms - you are agreeing upon terms by continuing! It's all part ensuring our compliance while enabling a sustainable project.
