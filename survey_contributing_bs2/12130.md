###  [Introduction] <a>
 We appreciate the effort  and the time taken on our part by contributors. Together as community partners of our code we build and maintain this software, making it available and usable by the rest of us all.** Contributions can vary from writing new documentation to fixing major software defects.

 Every single contribution helps the open resource and its adoption to new user bases. Whether it is the smallest correction and change or significant new features we are excited about it all, and the impact we can all do as one unit of community** It is through collaborative, continuous and shared growth the quality is maintained and the community flourishes and develops**! 

 Our success will depend greatly and entirely on a vibrant community. We are committed to creating welcoming and open spaces where every contribution is valued, every individual  respected;  and every voice considered **If you want to join, let' know how can best help.

### <center><b> <sup>2.</sup> </b><details><summary class="toc"><span  >Code of conduct</span></summary>< /></details> <details open="true"></details ></center> <br/>

 We expect a culture with open communications as one.  The project aims to cultivate a welcoming and respectful  environment for people of all backgrounds and levels of experience. Every single person has equal importance **

 Treat everyone as you would treat yourself in the situation, be considerate to others and avoid being rude or abusive, or any sort of harassment, whether that be through words or actions, online as a community or in person.** Respect differences of opinion, but ensure it's all done respectfully; constructive and helpful feedback and discussions, always **

 Violating code is a bad look in any situation, it could lead to being permanently removed from  the project community. Maintain the high values set,  respect others in the space and be an example for other contributors **The goal remains a positive space, with respect, safety of every participant.** We thank you!

 ## <sup>3.</sup>Getting Started
 First you'll need Git and a code or IDE editor **

 To download our software source files clone the repository to get your work started with your local setup; `git clone <repository URL>`** Next navigate the project folder to install our dependency management software. 

 To get your work setup you need to execute the installation procedure. Use: `npm install <dependencies> or similar`, or follow the `setup file for installation instructions.` The instructions in there are very easy and helpful; follow along for ease of set ** 

 After the dependencies have completed the download we can test to run the application. `npm start/ or similar`. Check that it's functional **The code can also be run via a docker image, see documentation for that approach**!

 Once the software starts successfully your local development environment has been configured **You can now branch from `main`, `develop or any other branch` to test, debug, and contribute changes, always with caution and care** We welcome all suggestions, feedback and code!

 ## <sup>3.</sup>How to Contribute

 Reporting a bug, adding new features, improving existing code and documenting the software -these can be some means. Each step will require different skill sets from different individuals **

 We welcome all forms of contributions, and we want all to join. If you' re unsure, ask us or the community, they would always be there **If we are working on large, significant changes, we're asking for all participants to discuss their ideas beforehand to avoid conflict or duplication**! We welcome all feedback from our participants in advance

 Submitting your contribution, create your code, make your documentation and push them all to create our collective resource **You'll create new branches to develop on and, finally when your feature or change works perfectly, submit the changes as Pull Request** The review will occur, so you must wait and be open for changes

 ## <details>[Reporting bugs](#Contribution)] <b>4.</b> <sup>4.</sup> <b>Reporting Bugs**
 To report a new bugs or issue in your software, please create the issue from this [GitHub Issues](GitHub link here) ** 

 When submitting a bug, please provide all relevant details, which should be concise and informative.**  Include a detailed description, environment information like your operating- system and browser version ** 

 A clear and simple to use example of your problem would be very helpful and useful to the reviewers.  The example code must demonstrate the defect in a concise and reproducible manner **It will significantly assist to resolve problems faster!

 If you' re not certain on steps, don' 't stress; simply describe how you can reproduce your problem, and we do the rest **Be descriptive and thorough as you can to assist the community**

  ## <sup>5.</sub>Suggest Enhancment
 We encourage suggestions on features **

 To share your idea for a new feature or enhancement, you need  a proposal with the reasons, benefits and use cases.** Be clear and concise on expectations and the impact on other code or users

 We review every submission to check that they align the project vision **If we like it, it is planned; otherwise, you can resubmit at a later stage ** We are always open for suggestions!

 We use this as our way to help, plan future enhancements **Our decision to adopt it is based and influenced by community needs as well and our strategic objectives ** The suggestions are prioritized based on factors, including complexity effort and value ** We value and appreciate your ideas, so do send! ## [Pull Request Process](#Contribution )
## <sup>6.</sup><b> Pull Request</b> 

 To get started with submitting new code, branch from `main`. Name branch as `<feature/fix>` with clear indication of the purpose and work done. **

 The pull is an integral component of contributing new code to the open resource project, it's important to follow our rules, or it will get rejected, or at the least, be difficult for our team **

 The pull must include all changes made to our open resources, including unit tests, new tests, or modifications that were added **The changes must pass all our unit tests, integration checks to pass, or we can't adopt them **

 After a pull gets approved, the maintain is responsible for applying your changes and, updating your changlogs with all relevant data **You, contributor, would be recognized for the hard work done, and it is a great experience!

 ##  <sup><sup>7.</sup> Coding Standart </sup><b>
 We follow our project specific coding rules and conventions.  These can be reviewed and adjusted **

 We have linting rules that will run to test the code, it is recommended and expected that these tests pass **It helps to maintain the consistency in formatting and readability, ensuring the codebase quality, it does**
  
 The project will have style guide, or follows existing industry standard, it will provide a standard **

 Our code uses `type- checking and automated documentation generation`, we require all to be updated and accurate **

## Testing Guidelines  
We expect to write tests as well and to maintain the quality ** 

 Run any existing test before committing and adding your new changes.  Use our existing unit testing framework to create any tests ** It ensures we do not break other features in the codebase, always **

 The project needs unit tests, and integration and regression to work, it is our expectation **If your feature is complex, add a new regression test and a new integration to verify functionality.

 

## <details open= "true"><b><sup>11 </sup><sup>11 </sup>Commit Message Guidelines** </a>
Commit messages provide insight to what's happening with code**

 All commit messages are descriptive as we want, it provides the context ** We encourage all to be concise and informative **

  All commit must use a prefix of `feat:`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, or refactor, this ensures it's clear on what's being added, or changed**
 ## <b>12. Branch Model
 We use a `gitflow branch strategy` for development ** 

 `Branching from `main/ or `develop` `is encouraged to allow for isolation` of work, it will allow you to test new feature, or fixes safely **

 The naming is important and should be `feature/my- feature` and `fix/fix my bug`, and `docs/ update documentation`, or so to follow the structure ** 

## <b>Review Process</b>
 We use a `code- review process ` for all pull request, a member of the maintenance team will inspect and check **

 The review team is available for assistance **If you want help, please ask and engage with the maintainers **

 If changes are required they' will ask for them in the `comments on pull request.` If it is accepted and approved then the change is adopted!
 

 ##<sup><sup>14.</sup> </sup>Communications Channels

 We are accessible at all times, please don' hesitate**

 You can join us to talk about ideas, concerns and suggestions on `our discord server.` or you can reach us at our `GitHub issue tracker` to discuss technical aspects ** 

##<sup>15.</sup> </b> Security and Response

 We are all in it together, we appreciate a community that shares knowledge, however, when issues are discovered we ask that they are not published, to allow us to solve the vulnerability ** 

 All information must be private and not published ** Please contact our `security team with private channels or encrypted emails` **

 ##<details><sup>16. </sup> <b>Reale Process<b> </a>
The `version` number increases with `major releases or bug fix releases.` It follows `semantic versioning`. **

 Tagging the code as a new version is done after successful builds and quality assurance **
