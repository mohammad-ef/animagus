## Getting Started

Before embarking into the contribution journey we strongly suggest that you clone the project repository, to a local environment. To do so, open terminal and initiate a clone by providing the Git URL to the repository `git clone <repository URL>`. After successful cloning, move into the created project directory `cd <project directory>`.

Create a new and dedicated branch to avoid any interference. This practice ensures any modifications remain contained, preventing accidental integration. You can do this utilizing commands `git switch -c develop` to branch from main, or if a specific feature or bugfix is needed, use commands `git switch -c feature/<relevant-feature>` or ` git switch -c fix/<relevant-bug>`.

The first stage of building the software locally is to navigate to the root directory, locate the dependencies file (e.g. requirements.txt, package.json) which details all dependencies required by the project to be installed. Then, run installation commands to obtain them: `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all packages in a 'requirements.txt' file, or `npm install`, for a package manager ' npm '. This command retrieves necessary files required to start your coding experience!   

To start the server or build, consult the ' README ' file for specific project instructions - it will have relevant instructions.  Commonly commands are `python ./ manage.py run` to begin a python web framework,  or a command such as ` npm start `to trigger the start event for a javascript/ node framework to start and initiate the build. Please check for errors during the installation and execution, ensuring your environment is properly configured and ready to work with!   

Finally, familiarize yourself with existing code and documentation. This initial understanding is essential for a successful and meaningful contribution and will reduce potential friction and misunderstandings during the coding experience. 

## How to Contribute

We welcome all sorts of involvement from community members. If you've stumbled upon a bug, please report it in the issue tracker on this GitHub repository! Got a great thought for something new? Share it by making a suggestion, and help us prioritize. Submitting a pull request, even a relatively small one, will make a real impact - we welcome every contribution from every contributor! 

Even documentation is an essential and often overlooked contribution. A well-organized, clear and concise documentation can improve a project, and it allows newcomers to get familiar more rapidly - if you notice something that requires improvement, please don't be afraid to improve or update the project docs - we will be delighted. We appreciate everyone, regardless of skills/experience who wish to contribute, and welcome them to the community.

Before diving into code, we kindly request you to chat with the project maintainer. It's a good approach to ensure the contribution aligns within our goals while preventing potential duplication. It can prevent unnecessary work while ensuring that all the changes implemented will provide a value to the broader platform. A discussion beforehand is a sign you want to collaborate and work with the team!   

If you're proposing a feature, try to think about who will use it & why, providing concrete and specific use cases. The better the proposal the easier the maintainers can assess the value and align the work with the overall objectives. It can help maintainers understand the value to decide the priorities - it helps the community. 

## Reporting Bugs

Finding bugs is inevitable in any coding project - we value the community' effort in pointing bugs and helping us make our projects more robust. Before submitting a bug you need to check if a bug exists on the same category or topic. A thorough check will also help maintain a tidy and clean issue tracking and avoid any confusion to the maintainers.

To ensure quick bug fixing and a clear understanding, we require a reproducible minimal example of steps that can reliably cause the bug to appear. This will save time and help the developers to focus on finding a fix. The clearer your steps, the easier the bug will be to address in a timely manner.

When submitting a bug, please provide a detailed description with the steps required to reproduce it. The description should be clear, and concise - also include your environment specifics (OS, version, software) for a quicker response. Report the bug directly within the GitHub Issues, under the " Bugs " label, and be descriptive about it to allow a quicker fix.  

Also, be sure to include any relevant error messages, logs, and stack traces which may help identify where the problem originates. Providing all relevant information will accelerate the bug fixing and allow the community to resolve the issue in an expedited timeframe.  

## Suggesting Enhancements

We are all about growth and innovation - we always welcome suggestions about new features, functionality, or improvement that could boost the quality of this software platform, making use of the tools easier and smoother. To submit your improvement idea, please create a " Enhancement " issue, detailing your suggestion.  

In your enhancement, please clearly explain your motivation, describing the problem the feature addresses or opportunity it exploits to enhance the overall user experience/ functionality. This can assist the community to understand the value to decide the priorities - it helps the community. Also, please describe a possible use case, detailing a scenario to illustrate how the enhancement would be applied.

The maintainers review all enhancement requests, prioritizing based on feasibility and community interest, and aligning the enhancement within the larger strategic objectives of the project. The discussion may involve feedback on the enhancement, and potential changes to be made - please stay open minded and collaborate with the team.

## Pull Request Process

To make a change, you must fork this GitHub repository. This creates a separate copy where you can implement your improvements. After that, create a branch for your changes. The branch name should be concise, descriptive, and adhere to the convention `feature/<relevant-feature>` if the changes implement a new feature, or `bugfix/<description of the bug>` for a bug related changes.   

To begin submitting your code, use the `git push origin <branch-name>` command, to upload your code to a forked repository. Once you have committed your modifications, navigate to your forked repository, and generate a ' Pull Request ' from the newly created branch towards the `main ` of the original repo. This signals the project maintainers to begin review.

The pull requested will go under scrutiny, and comments/ suggestions on areas of code will be provided - please address the suggestions promptly and update the ' Pull Request ' with new modifications. Once approved, merge is executed, and the community can use this improved code.   

## Coding Standards

To maintain uniformity and readability, we adopt a set of coding conventions. Indentation should use 4 spaces and no tabs, for improved cross-platform compatibility. Consistent naming conventions are crucial, where public attributes begin with a capital letter, whereas internal and helper attributes should begin with either an underscore `_ ` or a lowercase letter.

We enforce linting and type checking to catch errors and promote best practices, and to help maintain a high-quality and well structured codebase. We use a pre-configured `. eslintrc ` and `. flake config ` file that will automatically check your code for potential violations. Ensure your code passes all tests, and conforms to the coding standard before submitting a pull request.

We also emphasize thorough code documentation and inline comments, to help future developers understand the codebase. All public functions and classes should have detailed JSDoc-style documentation to explain their purpose, input parameters, returned values, and exceptional conditions or behavior.

## Testing Guidelines

Testing is vital in software development, ensuring stability, robustness - we strongly encourage all developers to create tests that cover a wide set of scenarios & edge cases, including unit & integration. The existing tests can be run with ` npm test ` or ` pytest `. Please make sure all your code is thoroughly validated, and it doesn not fail the existing automated test suite.   

To add your own tests, follow these guidelines: Unit tests should isolate individual components, while integration tests should verify interactions between different modules or layers of the system. Regression test should be used to ensure that existing features still function correctly after changes are made; this will help to catch unexpected regressions, and preserve stability, and reliability.

We support several testing frameworks like `Jest`, `Mocha`, & `Pytest`. The framework that's currently in use is detailed in `package.json` ( or ` requirement.txt`). If a new test requires additional dependencies, add it to the project dependencies file and install it using the appropriate package manager.

 ## Documentation Contributions

A well written and well maintained documentation is a vital component of a good project, and a valuable asset for the community. The documentation is primarily hosted on the same GitHub repository in the ` docs ` folder, and is written in Markdown files. To add or modify documentation, clone or fork the repository, and make the changes in the ` docs `/Markdown file in a new feature branch - then submit this as a PR.

When editing documentation, strive for clarity, conciseness, and consistency, ensuring all edits comply with the established style guide for this document to avoid any ambiguity. Please update the index to reflect the added or edited documentation to make the information readily accessible for users, and maintain consistent formatting - it helps the community! 

## Commit Message Guidelines

To facilitate easier navigation for future developers & contributors, please adhere to a strict and standard convention when writing commit messages. Each commit message should concisely describe the change it implements in the following format: " Type(Scope): Description ".  

We encourage the adoption of **Conventional Commits**, following a predefined scheme of ` feat ` , ` fix `, ` docs `, ` style `, ` refactor `, ` perf `, ` test `, or ` chore `, where appropriate scope can describe impacted sections, modules/files of your code, or components. A good practice for writing the message can look like ` feat(users): Implemented a search function`, for new functions that are added - for more detailed guidance visit ` conventionalcommits.org`. 

By adhering to or following standard convention in the message will make future version control more manageable for team and maintain better visibility in project updates & releases- we thank you. This allows the maintainers understand and categorize code and changes efficiently. 

## Branching Model

Our branching strategy follows the " Trunk-Based Development " methodology for agile & iterative code changes & deployments - it ensures seamless and consistent releases with a streamlined and effective approach. Contributors always create their feature branch, directly from `main ` rather than branching a 'develop ` for feature/development code.   

For small and incremental updates like bug-fixes the contributors should use a `bugfix ` or the convention name like` bugfix/add-user-input `, while significant enhancements and large refactoring work, they may create a feature branch: e.g. " feature/user-profiles `. All contributions eventually need to be merged in to the main ` after thorough testing and code-review - it improves team efficiency! 

## Review Process

All pull requests undergo a careful scrutiny & code review process prior to approval, to confirm compliance, and alignment within existing standards, while identifying opportunities of improvement. Maintainers are responsible to review pull requests and ensure high-quality standards are maintained within code contributions and to provide detailed guidance/suggestions as they review your submission! 

Please remain responsive and proactive in answering and incorporating maintainers comments. A constructive & proactive interaction with maintainers helps expedite review - also helps with team communication & collaboration to create an open dialogue. The approval of your `Pull Request ` marks its successful merge back to `main`, and integration, marking the completion of contribution process & the beginning of utilization - you helped our team and we appreciate your assistance! 

## Communication Channels

Our maintainers communicate on GitHub Issues primarily- where bug fixes are documented and reported- alongside pull request conversations and feedback threads to provide clear communication & ensure all concerns & discussions stay associated to relevant change - to facilitate efficient communication between all parties & the broader contributor.

The broader communication is maintained using `discord` (link provided here ) channel, for instant & open community engagement- which facilitates informal and ad hoc discussion on topics & challenges related to the overall project goals & progress to maintain collaboration across teams!

## Security and Responsible Disclosure

Responsible disclosures of any possible security risks, or any vulnerability are extremely valuable in ensuring overall integrity, & resilience of this platform. Please don `t publicly share details concerning security flaws on social channels & forums`.   

Reach out to `security@company.com`, for accurate disclosure and prompt handling to address any potential vulnerability or threat - our maintainers prioritize resolving the issues, while also safeguarding all the contributors! 

## Release Process

Release cycle follows an automatic continuous integration, & release strategy - with all merges made in `main` immediately triggered, which will be built and tested for any errors or defects and released accordingly in an appropriate format- with an incremental and agile approach in deployment - to provide rapid access for all. Each deployment will automatically be versioned following semantic-versioning guidelines (` MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). Changelogs for these changes will automatically get added - ensuring the maintainability across platforms/tools/frameworks to ensure transparency, traceability for contributors and broader ecosystem

## Recognition

The efforts contributed towards improvement will have merit in various recognition methods. Contributions receive acknowledgements/creditation listed alongside ` Contributors` and within each commit logs & the change history, to provide proper creditation of efforts to improve community. Additionally we appreciate contributors, for quality/consistence code and overall positive contribution to community to build an effective project for the wider ecosystem & stakeholders to use for their benefit!
