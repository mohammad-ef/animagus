# How We Contribute

Welcome! We're thrilled you are here and considering to contribute. Your expertise helps us create better software! Contributing can be more than just code - it involves providing constructive criticism, testing, documentation, design suggestions, and much more.

We strongly belief that a project's vitality depends on a community of active participants; your efforts matter, no matter if big or small. Please review the below to get started on collaborating successfully.

Whether you're a coding expert or a user with a keen observation of the experience, your contributions will help us to improve and grow. We appreciate everyone' willingness to engage with the project and help build the best solution for a wide audience.

## 1. Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a collaborative, respectful, and inclusive environment for all.  Our community welcomes contributions from developers, users of all backgrounds, and experience levels. 

We expect all members to communicate respectfully, and to engage with each other professionally. Discrimination in all forms, including but not limited to race, ethnic or racial origin, religious belief, gender, gender equality, age, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, marital status, is completely intolerable.

Violating behavior, which includes disrespectful, discriminatory comments can result in warnings; suspension, and even, in extreme cases, permanent exclusion from the project, and the community involved.  We encourage everyone to address issues and concerns privately, if possible. 

We value a space where everyone feels safe contributing, and your cooperation is required to maintain such a standard. If you experience or witness any behavior contrary to these guidelines please report it to [insert contact for reports, e.g., maintain email address] promptly.

## 2.  Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have a suitable development environment. A good text editor, Git software, and the necessary programming language tools will be helpful. We use Git for version control.

To set up the project you should first clone this code repository, by entering the following commands. First, ensure git is installed:  `git --version`. Then: `git clone <repository URL>`.  Once cloned, you are good to go.

Create a new branch for your contribution, so you don' t affect the main code: `git checkout -b feature/your-contribution`.  Always ensure you keep this new branch up by re-basing or mergeing the main code.  

After completing the work, commit it using clear, concise messages following established guidelines.  Push your new branch to the repository and create a pull request, as described more specifically below in the PR section. This will start the revision and approval.

Finally, ensure before you start contributing you have all the necessary dependancies by navigating to the root folder and running `npm install` (or equivalent). This will download all dependencies from the package.json file and configure the project.

## 3. How to Contribute

We encourage a variety of contributions, not limited to just code changes. Submitting a clear bug report, suggesting a new feature, or improving documentation is just as valuable to the project as a substantial coding improvement.

If you spot a bug and have found how to reproduce it, reporting it on the GitHub issue tracker is an excellent way to contribute. This way the maintainers, and other contributors know what the issue is. 

We welcome feedback and suggestions for new features or improvements. Openly sharing thoughts can lead to a much more comprehensive solution, so don't be shy. Please do so on the dedicated discussion board for feature requests or new suggestions.

Submitting pull requests (PRs) is the main mechanism for incorporating your code changes into the project. Make sure your PR is well-documented, with tests, and addresses an existing issue whenever possible.

Before starting a substantial implementation of a feature, discuss it with the core maintain team. Early feedback on the approach can help ensure the change aligns with project goals, and avoid wasted effort.

## 4. Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug, search the existing issues to see if it has already been reported. If the same issue is identified, consider adding additional information to the existing report rather than creating a new one.

When reporting, be as specific as possible, describing your environment (operating system, programming language version) as precisely as possible. This can greatly facilitate reproducing and identifying a bug.

Include a detailed reproduction process - a clear, step-by-step set of actions. Ideally, you would provide a concise code snippet that triggers the bug in the project or within an online tool such as JS fiddle or CodePen.

A clear error message is crucial - copy and paste the entire error output into your report, along with relevant information like what page, input etc triggered it.  Report new bugs and improvements using GitHub issues.  Link existing reports in the issues you file.

## 5. Suggesting Enhancements

We appreciate thoughtful ideas to make the project better. Share them with a concise problem definition or motivation and details describing exactly how to solve.

If possible provide use case(s). Explain the specific problem your suggestions addresses, or an existing issue. Also consider if there are potential downsides for other contributors of such improvement, and address it as part of your suggestions.

Our core maintain team reviews suggested improvements on a rolling basis. They evaluate based on the scope of change and alignment with project's vision, resources, time-availability. We'll get back to you within [mention expected timeframe e.g., 1 weeks] if possible.

## 6. Pull Request Process

When creating a Pull Request ensure your PR addresses a related or specified Issue on GitHub. Use branching as detailed above and include the PR related ID into the description of your contribution.

Name branches following the pattern: `feature/<descriptive-name>` or `fix/<descriptive-name>`. For minor bug fixes use the same structure, ensuring name clearly states what you aim to improve with your fix.

The Pull Request process includes code review. Expect to be contacted on areas of improvements with the reviewers. Ensure to provide detailed and clear commit messages as mentioned in Section 11, to ensure a seamless transition to final versioning.

The pull request is automatically validated. Tests, Linting and documentation checks need to succeed to get accepted into the project, so run your validations prior to submission! 

Upon approval the core maintain team, or an authorised person will merge the changes. The PR should not cause issues and must align with overall vision of the projects, so feedback is critical at that time.

## 7. Coding Standards

Adhering to a common coding style and conventions greatly improve readability, and consistency of all contribution on this repository. This allows easier for maintainers to read new commits!

Indent with two spaces, not tabs. Use standard capitalization practices, e.g. camel-case is often a great way of naming methods, as a convention in our community. Keep code blocks to an appropriate length of less than 80 characters if possible.

The repository includes pre-configured Linting checks, that must be executed during validation of the contribution and must succeed before being submitted for validation by an reviewer.  We also perform code formatting validation checks to align with standard code guidelines, using tools [Name tools].

We encourage the thorough inclusion of inline and external comments. Documentation must explain complex and tricky areas or decisions that you may have undertaken when developing your contributions. Ensure comments stay in alignment with changes, as old documentation will be useless, if you make modifications that overwrite them!

## 8. Testing Guidelines

Write comprehensive tests.  Include at minimum Unit, and at the bare minimum Integration Tests and a good selection of regression tests. This increases project maintainability!

We use a standard Test-Driven Development, TDD process to validate our existing functionalities, ensuring all the current functionality is well supported. This can act as a guideline when creating and testing for improvements!

Run existing tests regularly with a `pytest` (or relevant command):  `pytest`. This allows detection and early mitigation of regressions from any code improvements made. We recommend using continuous integration to test all the features!

When writing tests aim for complete branch coverage; that includes executing your contribution with different data inputs or conditions that might arise within production scenarios. Ensure to thoroughly describe the tests that your code includes and its implications within comments of each file and within external files (READMEs etc.)

## 9. Documentation Contributions

We appreciate documentation! Clear and updated docs allow users and contributors.  If a function/tool has no clear documentation that should also get a document created before it is released into public.

The source code contains its own built-in docs as comments; ensure your code comments explain what you aim to implement as best possible! Also include a high level of details, explaining the testing methodology you use as best as possible!

Update and improve docs. Add missing details or explanations for complex topics within documentation or READMEs as much as you think they might need improving or clarifying, for your and others use. The projects documentation exists at /docs/. 

Please keep existing document structure when making compression/adjustments. Changes in overall document layout are difficult to process.  Please add your new contributions as separate files in the '/docs' directories for consistency with project layout, or adjust existing documentation appropriately and in alignment.

## 10. Commit Message Guidelines

Writing good commit messages ensures project transparency! A well-documented message enables easy debugging and understanding of the history in case future regressions are discovered and investigated!

Each commit message should have a brief and precise summary of changes within it, ideally in under 50 characters! The body only if more explanations of changes need more context, to understand. This should be followed up within clear formatting for maintainability.

Adhere to Conventional Commits specification ( [link to conventional commits documentation]). Common types can be "feat", "fix", "docs", "style", "refactor", "perf", "test", and other prefixes, with the scope, followed by colon (:), with clear message description of the action undertaken within a change.

Example, to improve documentation `docs(API): Clarify API rate limit`.

Avoid unnecessary or confusing details. Keep commit messages to concise statements to describe what you changed within that commit and why; if necessary include references or URLs that can further align context and details to your code change within your documentation or commit description

## 11. Branching Model

We currently employ a standard branching approach where contributions will come in feature based branching. `main` always reflects latest, released versions; so contributions shouldn t go into there

Your branch starts off the master `main` by `git checkout main`. This should always ensure the branch has latest features. From `main` then your branching occurs using your feature based names such as `git checkout -b feature/myImprovement`.

Avoid making long living branching strategies that might get difficult to reconcile at merge points! It increases difficulty with merges; so merge and integrate often and resolve conflict quickly to minimize risks to code.

## 12. Review Process

Code reviews ensure code-quality! The code maintain team carefully assesses your changes against coding guidelines as defined above as per standard project conventions to assess alignment of new improvements with current practices.

Reviewers offer suggestions and feedback and ask probing questions; ensure responses are detailed and well considered. Be responsive with reviewers as delays with responses increases risk to stability of contributions!

Following approvals from review board you are then given final approval! This ensures the quality is high enough before merging the code, to ensure the overall quality standards is kept in-tact and the community continues to enjoy a seamless development lifecycle.

## 13. Communication Channels

For immediate help, consider our project Slack (insert slack link), as you and any collaborators within it might find answers more immediately from our team and collaborators. We use the GitHub Issues to discuss bugs and new ideas (link: github issue url).

Discussions regarding design are held over [Discord / Email list etc] with specific topics and context; you may join and engage if there, for suggestions. 

Be mindful with the tone when posting. Remember, all of communication is conducted through digital means! It increases the potential that misunderstandings can take place! 

## 14. Security and Responsible Disclosure

Please contact us via security [at example.com], or through github, to inform on security related risks.  Be mindful not to discuss vulnerabilities in the issues section or in a open public platform, where bad actors may attempt exploitation before remediation has started

We appreciate and expect a coordinated responsible disclosure and do everything as a project and team, in good-faith towards protecting users of your contributions; and to keep project secure and stable at all points of release or iteration cycles.  Be prepared for an answer, to the best that the development resources allows.

## 15. Release Process

We prepare the Major and minor version releases on regular cycles and try as part of that to follow best and industry leading practices with release and version numbers. builds for major/minor release cycle happen every three month. Patch version updates happen ad-hoc based upon security findings or stability needs, on as need to occur basis.

Before any official release; all code becomes thoroughly checked through the team.  A tag and version release notes file is generated and published within a dedicated section and release area.

Deployment occurs via our standard release channels, and automated deployment processes, and we expect that our maintainer and norms within project team to maintain this standard.

## 16. Recognition

We acknowledge our contributor through repository acknowledgements (link here). The contribution log will include details and a description for their changes to acknowledge them for the value that was provided

Contributors get featured in the website and the README as much as we feel their value needs and contributes within project success - and the level/amount will align directly based off value added, time and resources to support this.   Please be mindful about contribution values as that determines how recognition occurs.

## 17. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All external contribution require acceptance by an official Contribution Agreement! By doing so, it means contributors have legal agreements to assign their intellectual ownership to this project and ensures it's free, legal access to everyone to improve this product, or contribute.

To contribute and participate in this community and contribute your time/work, sign and provide acceptance on [Insert Link for Signing of Agreements]!  Failure to provide such an acknowledgment and CLA stops all external work from entering, or staying within project!

## 18. Resources and References

Check these standard coding resources and practices: [PEP8], [Google style Guide], etc.. Ensuring these practices helps keep all coding aligned, and consistent! We value community engagement as we learn to evolve and change and encourage all contributions and ideas that come forth and evolve from the contributions made within it.
